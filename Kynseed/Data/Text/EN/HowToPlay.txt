Name|How to make friends (or enemies) and influence people
Text|You can gain Friendship Points (FP) by helping folk and raising friendship.

All Quillians have their likes and dislikes, and finding out about these can be the key to your relationship with a person.

Regular gifts of liked or loved items will encourage people to look forward to your visits; tell you their life stories; share <link:proverbs>proverbs<link>and gossip about their neighbours; <link:itempermissions>allow<link>you to take things from their land; become part of a building team for your projects, or even eventually give you access to their valuable family heirlooms! People are always particularly touched if you remember their birthdays...

Folk sometimes drops heavy hints for items with a particular <link:traits>trait<link>. Gifting a suitable item will make them grateful enough to pass on Gossip about other villagers, collectable items, or some interesting lore. Conversely, people will become much less well-disposed and helpful to you if you hurt them, give them things they dislike, or mess up their homes.

Name|Tools
Text| Usage increases your proficiency with fishing rods, pickaxes, sickles, slingshots, shovels, and swords. This unlocks valuable perks and can also improve the <link:stars>quality<link>of the items you collect or the damage you do in combat.

Tool unlocks are separate from any <link:skills>skills<link>that you earn from Masters, like Twig. Check your proficiency level by viewing the tool in your inventory.

Proficiency applies to the type of tool - for example, you can change from a tin to a zinc shovel without penalty.

Different metals affect the world in various ways, so it can be worth having more than one of each tool type (though you can only ever have one rod and pickaxe).

Name|Traits, or what are those icons over people's heads?
Text|Traits affect people by temporarily changing their skills or demeanor, e.g. making them run faster, be more friendly or smell nice.

For example, a high-quality pie will have a strong, long-lasting effect.

A maximum of three traits can be active at one time. Consuming a new item will replace any currently active traits.

Pets may get ill after prolonged periods without being fed. They might go green, poor things. Like dear old Uncle Bill, they would benefit from being given something with the Healing trait.

Press <whistle>to view the pet whistle. You can check a pet's age, whereabouts, fullness and mood. You can also summon the pet or send them home.

Name|가족들
Text|가족들. 가족을 얼마나 사랑하는지! 킨시드에서는 가족 생활을 즐겁고 생산적으로 만들 수 있는 다양한 방법이 있습니다.

우선, 가족이 필요합니다. NPC에게 구애하고, 결혼하고, 입양하거나 아이를 낳으면 가족이 생깁니다. 아이들은 몇 년이 지나야 '쓸모 있는' 존재가 되지만, 속도를 높이고 싶다면 언제든지 페어웨더 씨를 찾아갈 수 있습니다.

가족 스케줄러는 윌로우다운 농장의 실내에서 찾을 수 있습니다. 이 스케줄러를 사용해 농사부터 공부까지 가족에게 명령을 내릴 수 있습니다. 가족을 먹이를 구하러 보낼 수도 있습니다. 18세 이상은 원할 경우 전투에 투입할 수 있습니다.

사업을 운영하는 경우 사업장에서 일하기를 원할 수도 있습니다.

가족 구성원이 여러분을 대신해 여러 가지 일을 하고 있다고 가정해 봅시다. 이 경우 우선순위가 자동으로 모임, 상점 작업, 그다음 일정 순으로 설정되고, 그 다음 가족 스케줄러에 지정된 일정에 따릅니다..

Name|커스터마이징
Text|플레이어는 윌로우다운 농장과 농장 구역의 넓은 부분을 커스터마이징할 수 있습니다.

커스터마이징에 접근하려면 윌로우다운 농장에 있는 동안 지도를 열거나, 농가에 있는 경우 커스터마이징 테이블을 통해 상호작용할 수 있습니다. 이렇게 하면 윌로우다운 농장의 지도 보기가 열립니다.

커스터마이징하려는 영역을 선택합니다. 회색 아이콘이 있는 영역은 반드시 구매해야 플레이할 수 있습니다.

창고에 보관된 물건은 나중에 사용할 수 있습니다. 일부 물건은 실내 또는 실외에서만 사용할 수 있습니다.
판매한 물건은 제거되지만, 판매하면 브라스 보너스를 받습니다.

커스터마이징을 배우는 가장 좋은 방법은 직접 플레이해보는 것입니다. 게임 시간이 일시 정지되므로 게임을 하는 동안 어떤 이벤트도 놓치지 않을 수 있습니다.
초보 디자이너에게 알려드리고 싶은 팁 중 하나는 미세 조정 옵션을 사용해 보는 것입니다. 이 옵션을 사용하면 많은 오브젝트를 사각형 안에 더 정확하게 배치할 수 있습니다. 이를 통해 덜 획일적이고 유기적인 레이아웃을 만들 수 있습니다.
