Name|Recipe Book
ID|recipe_book
Text|The coloured tabs at the side of the book represent the different kinds of food you can make: <link:soup>soups<link>, <link:jam>jams<link>, <link:stew>stews<link>, <link:pie>pies<link>, <link:pud>puddings<link>, <link:bread>bread<link> and <link:bread>sandwiches<link>. Use them to find particular recipes more quickly. Recipes are added to the book as you discover them.

Each recipe shows the three or five ingredients required to make it, and will be greyed out if you don't have them all in your inventory.  Select <ui_accept_or_click> a recipe to start crafting.

Cooked foods have traits that can affect the person eating them. At first, these are shown with '???' but will be revealed once you have made the recipe.

You can use the Filter button to show only recipes that will be useful for a particular activity such as a date, combat, bartering, or for many other things.  The selected recipes will have traits that will help improve your performance in your chosen activity.

Name|Soups
ID|soup
Text|Soups have the simplest of all cooking processes: blend three ingredients and add each to the pot before the timer runs out.  Doing this perfectly on the first attempt will improve the Star Rating of your soup by one.

Name|1 - Ingredient Selection
ID|soupinv
Text|The Ingredient Selection screen appears after you've selected a recipe from the <link:recipe_book>book<link>.

Using <ui_accept_or_click> the Add Highest Rated button automatically selects each required ingredient from your inventory.  Each one will be at the highest available Star Rating. Add Lowest Rated does the opposite.

Select <ui_accept_or_click> an ingredient to manually add it to the crafting box instead, selecting the desired Star Rating with <ui_alt_or_rightclick>.

The completed recipe's Star Rating will be mainly based on the average rating of your ingredients.  <ui_alt_or_rightclick> on ingredients in the crafting box to remove them; you can then replace the ingredient with one of a different Star Rating.

The Batch Crafting option will appear if you have successfully made soups at least three times. This allows you to produce multiple items at once. Scroll to choose the number of ingredients to use - limited to the number you have or up to 10. Note that the number of items to be crafted might be higher than this; Mr Fairweather's items, skills and shop Perks can be used to help boost the yield.

Name|2 - Making
ID|soupmake
Text|• Select <ui_accept_or_click> an ingredient from the shelf on the left to put it into the grinder. It doesn't matter which one you choose first.
• Press <ui_accept_or_click> the Hob's head to start the grinder rotating.
• <ui_accept_or_click> again to stop once the arrows line up. If you miss, the grinder will shake and will rotate more slowly. You have three chances per ingredient.
• Once the ingredient is ground, it is added to the pot. The cooking timer flips over and starts running.
• Add and grind the other two ingredients before the sand runs to the bottom of the timer.

Text|This screen shows the item that you crafted, unless you failed to add all of the ingredients to the pot before the timer ran out - in which case you will get a message to say that the soup was ruined and the ingredients wasted.

The centre rosette shows a picture of the completed soup; the number of portions created; and its Star Rating.  Banners to the left show the soup's traits.  These traits will be added to the soup's entry in the recipe book.

The Calculation button will provide more information on the soup's Star Rating - this is initially based on the average Star Rating of the ingredients used.  An additional star may be gained by stopping the grinder at the correct point on the first attempt at grinding each ingredient.

Name|Jams
ID|jam
Text|Jams are all about multi-tasking.  Chop all of the ingredients and get them into the pot before time runs out -  but don't let them get too hot or cold!  Keeping your jam at the perfect temperature at all times will improve its Star Rating by one.

Name|2 - Chopping and Simmering
ID|jammake
Text|• Select <ui_accept_or_click> an ingredient from the shelf on the left to move it to the chopping board.  You will discover that chopping some ingredients takes more time or skill than others.  You may want to make note of these, so that you can decide the best order in which to select your ingredients.
• The best knife for the job will appear. Use <ui_accept_or_click> it to chop the ingredients - finding the right rhythm can help you chop more efficiently. Once you've sliced sufficiently, the Chopping Board will tip up and allow you to scrape the ingredient into the pot, starting the timer.
• The pot's temperature will drop each time an ingredient is added. Use the lever on the base of the pot to adjust the heat upwards <ui_tabNext_or_click> the lever on its base to the right and keep the temperature indicator in the simmering zone in the middle of the thermometer.
• Adjust the heat downwards with <ui_tabPrev_or_click> if the jam starts bubbling really hard and the heat is in the red zone. If the temperature stays in the cold blue area or the red boiling area for too long, your jam-making attempt will fail!
• Keep an eye on the temperature while chopping the other ingredients. You can switch between chopping and using the temperature lever at any time.
• Make sure that you add all three ingredients before the timer runs out.

• The best knife for the job will appear. Use it to chop the ingredients - finding the right rhythm can help you chop more efficiently. Once you've sliced sufficiently, the Chopping Board will tip up and allow you to scrape the ingredient into the pot, and the ingredient's timer will flip over and start running.
• Choose the ingredient with the next-longest cooking time and chop it. You can choose when to scrape it into the pot.
• Aim to get all three timers to run out simultaneously, with all three ingredients simmering in the pot.

Name|Pies
ID|pie
Text|Of all cooked foods, pies require the most skillful cook.  Chop fillings, make and roll out just the right amount of pastry, then make sure that all ingredients are cooked evenly.  Though there is some effort involved, pies can be sold for higher prices than some of the more simple foods.

Name|1 - Ingredient Selection
ID|pieinv
Text|The Ingredient Selection screen appears after you've selected a recipe from the <link:recipe_book>book<link>.  Pies require three ingredients for their fillings, but also need flour and eggs for their pastry.

Using <ui_accept_or_click> the Add Highest Rated button automatically selects each required ingredient from your inventory.  Each one will be at the highest available Star Rating. Add Lowest Rated does the opposite.

Select <ui_accept_or_click> an ingredient to manually add it to the crafting box instead, selecting the desired Star Rating with <ui_alt_or_rightclick>. Your selection will be ticked off the list and added to the food tray. It can be removed by selecting <ui_accept_or_click> it again.

Higher quality ingredients (those with the most stars) will improve the quality of your pie, but they are more delicate and, therefore more difficult to cook to perfection. Choose wisely!

Flour and eggs don't have rating variations, so just chuck 'em in.

Once you're happy with the selection in the tray, click the pie button at its base to start baking.

At this point, the eggs and flour will magically combine to make dough for the pie lining and lid.

The Batch Crafting option will appear if you have successfully made pies at least three times. This allows you to produce multiple items at once. Scroll to choose the number of ingredients, eggs and flour to use - limited to the number you have or up to 10.

Name|3 - Rolling Pastry
ID|pierolling
Text|Keep changing the angle of the rolling pin and pushing it along with <ui_accept_or_click> to make the dough cover the darker target circle. Try not to overshoot too much and waste your pastry, or you may not have enough to cover your pie completely!

A perfectly covered circle earns you a gold banner: otherwise, a hint on silver.

Once you've finished rolling out, the pastry is automatically trimmed and used to top your pie.

Name|4 - Baking
ID|piebaking
Text|Use <ui_accept_or_click> the paddle to slide your pie into the oven to begin baking it.

Watch the Baking Meter on the right. As the pie cooks, orange and green bars appear on the meter. Aim to stop <ui_accept_or_click> the meter on each of the green bars. But don't wait too long - they'll shrink as the pie starts to overcook, and once they disappear, your pie will be burned! The more accurate you are here, the better the quality of your pie.  You'll see a gold banner after this stage if so: otherwise, a hint on silver.

Once you've made your three marks on the Meter, use <ui_accept_or_click> the paddle to take your pie out of the oven and see its Star Rating and traits.
