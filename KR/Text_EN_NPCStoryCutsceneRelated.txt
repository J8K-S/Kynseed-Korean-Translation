NPCStory_Like_EdnaTeapottIntro |= How are you faring, dearie? I am keeping myself busy, mainly watching those Kettles.
NPCStory_Like_EdnaTeapottOutro |= Ignatius and Holly can keep each other. He's a sour old goat, and she's a brass-digger.
NPCStory_Like_ArthurBrownIntro |= Oh man, I should tell you about a dream I had last night.
NPCStory_Like_ArthurBrownOutro |= However, what is really strange is that I went to bed hungry and woke up full. That's like, wow, so freaky. Do you think we can actually eat in our dreams and be nourished? Crazy.

NPCStory_Friendly_HazelNuttIntro |= You look like you could be a trustworthy cat lover. Am I right? I do hope so. There are three things in this world you can rely on. Cats. More Cats. And milk.
NPCStory_Friendly_HazelNuttIntro |= I once had a fella who I hoped would show me the world.
NPCStory_Friendly_HazelNuttOutro |= I like to think he got flushed.
NPCStory_Friendly_IcabodMoonIntro |= I didn't always want to be a shopkeeper, you know? When I was a lad, I wanted to be an adventurer.
NPCStory_Friendly_IcabodMoonOutro |= So that put an end to my dreams. Sad eh?
NPCStory_Love_PatCoweIntro |= I may have sneaked some of Tom's secret beer stash, and my lips feel looser than a pair of trousers on a Remnant. I told you before that we used to have a child. In some ways, we still do.
NPCStory_Love_PatCoweOutro |= We had a kid called Peppy. Silly beggar was a wild one. Only went and had a pee against a Goddess Statue. So they punished him and made him old. Yep, that's Pappy. Loves his milk like he was still seven.
NPCStory_Love_PatCoweOutro |= Anyway, I suppose you are after some sort of task to prove your friendship? I was thinking old Pappy never really gets any roughage, so perhaps you could make him a top-quality meal like a Simpletons Stew?
NPCStory_Love_TheresaBrownIntro |= May I discuss something? It is a little bit, shall we say, sensitive and requires discretion. I caught Arthur in our cellar with a pork chop draped right over his face.
NPCStory_Love_TheresaBrownOutro |= When I confronted him, he broke down in tears and told me he just wanted to sample something meaty. He missed meat so much but didn't want to upset me, us being vegetarian, you see.
NPCStory_Love_TheresaBrownOutro |= I think we need to get rid of it and remove temptation once and for all. Could you grab that blasted pork chop in the store just below our house? I am convinced it is cursed and has put a spell on him.
NPCStory_Love_TheresaBrownOutro |= Then, go to the Pool of Passing in the Burial Grounds, where the funerals take place and throw it in. That is where meat goes, so what have we got to lose?
NPCStory_Love_TheresaBrownOutro |= Thank you.
NPCStory_Like_TomCoweIntro |= I used to be a miner, you know?
NPCStory_Like_TomCoweOutro |= Yep, I worked down underground. Then I ran into the Knockers. You should see 'em! They rushed me, and I blacked out.
NPCStory_Like_TomCoweOutro |= Since then, I just couldn't handle going back in. Mining was my life. Now all I have to get me into the deep dark is the lovely, soft embrace of ale.
NPCStory_Like_EdwardWoodIntro |= I wasn't exactly straight with you previously. I might like the quiet life now, but I used to be an adventurer. I was a pretty good slayer of monsters, and so was my wife.
NPCStory_Like_EdwardWoodOutro |= I vowed revenge but never stepped into the woods again.
NPCStory_Love_RogerReadilyIntro |= I have a secret I can't bear keeping anymore! Despite my stunning looks and wonderful loving techniques, lately, my libido is having a libido-go.
NPCStory_Love_RogerReadilyOutro |= I need something to help me rediscover my mojo, and if you think I am doing more references, think again! There's a truffle, buried deep, that boosts virility like a boot up a chicken's backside.
NPCStory_Like_PoppySeedIntro |= What do you think you will come back as after you pass into nature? 
NPCStory_Like_PoppySeedIntro |= I think I will make a beautiful bird. Something colourful with a wonderful song.
NPCStory_Like_PoppySeedIntro |= My parents taught me how to sing. My father was a bard, and my mother was a songstress. We travelled the land and lived off what people would throw at us.
NPCStory_Like_PoppySeedOutro |= I didn't say my parents were any good.
NPCStory_Like_NerysNailIntro |= Do you think my hair looks good? Hannah says it always looks really shiny and healthy. I think it must be due to where I grew up as a kid.
NPCStory_Like_NerysNailIntro |= I am the daughter of a family from Pineshade up in the north, you see? Around there, it is all beautiful scented pine trees and clusters of fragrant wildflowers. I would forage and use what I could find to make beautiful shampoos.
NPCStory_Like_NerysNailOutro |= My hair seems to have survived the smoky forge, so it must be top quality, don't you think? All those shampoos!
NPCStory_Like_NerysNailOutro |= I used to visit my parents up there and forage, but when the bridge to the north collapsed, I couldn't get to see them. I heard a dragon did it, and nobody dared fix it.
NPCStory_Like_NerysNailOutro |= I bet its breath is not as hot as Hannah's forge!
NPCStory_Love_DickTurnipIntro |= You are the only outsider who ever gave me time. I love Kat and Luca and always will. I just wish I could find a way to get out of my rut.
NPCStory_Love_DickTurnipIntro |= I did hear that the Fae have a flower that lifts the spirits. A type of funny sunflower, I think?
NPCStory_Love_DickTurnipOutro |= If I had my crop squares full of those, I reckon that might do the trick!
NPCStory_Love_DickTurnipOutro |= Yes, I am hinting
NPCStory_FriendlyEunLivingstunIntro |= You are a hero! Capital of you to become my ally in these dark times.
NPCStory_FriendlyEunLivingstunIntro |= Do you want to join in my fantasy, fighting all manner of monsters?
NPCStory_FriendlyEunLivingstunIntro |= From the forest where doom awaits to dungeons full of deathtraps and swamps full of scorpions... adventure awaits on every page!
NPCStory_FriendlyEunLivingstunIntro |= The books, of course! I just love these books where you choose your own path without crossing any legal boundaries.
NPCStory_FriendlyEunLivingstunOutro |= One minute you could be raiding tombs, and the next, in a snowy cavern, having tea with a witch.
NPCStory_FriendlyEunLivingstunOutro |= And by tea, I mean whacking her with a big plus 3 sword called Witchbonker.
NPCStory_Like_FroggHermitIntro |= Ohhhh, sing-a-long with me... 'Hedgehog, hedgehog on your kite, Like a shadow in the night'. Oh yes, I forgot, you already know I am not eccentric!
NPCStory_Like_FroggHermitIntro |= I do still think you are after my charms, though. I have so many in the house to protect me from everything from mischievous weevils to evil Ken Evil, the daring devil.
NPCStory_Like_FroggHermitIntro |= My parents were wanderers and sold charms and wards to the folk of Quill. I just loved the jangly sounds they made as our little pig-pulled cart ambled through the land, the trees as our bedposts.
NPCStory_Like_FroggHermitOutro |= Don't say a word.
NPCStory_Like_MoLawnIntro |= Daddy always worked hard so I would not have to.
NPCStory_Like_MoLawnIntro |= When I was introduced to Greene, although he was not of top quality, he had an 'earthiness' about him. Like Daddy, he worked hard and even brought me a bucket of flowers. Hyacinths.
NPCStory_Like_MoLawnIntro |= I threw them away, of course, as I have to be keeping up appearances.
NPCStory_Like_MoLawnOutro |= I think we are a good match, really. I raise his quality, and he insists on doing the cooking.
NPCStory_Friendly_StarSapphireIntro |= I have so many questions! What kind of music do you like? Who is your favourite bard? Do you play any instruments?
NPCStory_Friendly_StarSapphireIntro |= I am still hoping to one day become just like Lyric. Isn't she just the coolest person ever?
NPCStory_Friendly_StarSapphireIntro |= I have so many questions for her, too, but I don't think she meets fans.
NPCStory_Friendly_StarSapphireOutro |= Oh! Sorry about that. I daydreamed a little bit then! Sigh! I wish I could meet Lyric so I can give her Yums and Roses.
NPCStory_Like_RavenLoonIntro |= I found out that people used to write stories about horrible things, and they were called horror stories. We still tell ghost stories around here, but apparently, these were tales of gore and terror.
NPCStory_Like_RavenLoonOutro |= I write my own now and keep them hidden away because nobody would understand, especially Sal.
NPCStory_Friendly_NedScrumpyIntro |= I had a feeling we might get on well. I despair of my family. Father has ambitions but no follow-through. Mother has no ambitions and nothing to follow through. Jed just follows through.
NPCStory_Friendly_NedScrumpyIntro |= I want to get out there into the world and earn my keep properly.
NPCStory_Friendly_NedScrumpyOutro |= Maybe not an apothecary.
NPCStory_Intro_MelanieJuggIntro |= Hello there! I'm Melanie. I run the local pub with my father, Toby. It's called the Flailing Arms. I remember when my father first bought it...
NPCStory_Intro_MelanieJuggOutro |= I run the business now, and you can't smell anything bad anymore. We also do a range of non-alcoholic refreshments and have the outhouse cleaned weekly.
NPCStory_Like_LewisFlushingIntro |= Can I tell you a secret? When I was little, and we hadn't been blessed yet, my mother showed me a book she had hidden. It was an heirloom that was passed down through our family. It was called Peter Pan. It was about a really annoying boy who never grew up. He had a pet fairy, and he fought adults with his sword.
NPCStory_Like_LewisFlushingOutro |= I always wanted to be just like that Peter fella. I will never fly though.
NPCStory_Love_JacobCrackleIntro |= I want to tell you something. I am only telling this to you as we are now the best of friends. 
NPCStory_Love_JacobCrackleIntro |= I once saw Mag the Moghog in Cuckoo Wood. Was across the river by those tall rock columns, sleeping.
NPCStory_Love_JacobCrackleOutro |= I made a note of my experience in this book. You can have it, seeing as we are pals. You know that you can hand over items at Mag, and it'll spit back the same item, only better?!
NPCStory_Love_JacobCrackleOutro |= I only ask one favour.
NPCStory_Love_JacobCrackleOutro |= I dare not dig up any of those old graves, but the trouble is, I once buried a Tin Ward there out of superstition, and now I need it back. I fear I may have upset the spirits or Goddesses by burying it.
NPCStory_Love_RakeGrassbeardIntro |= We are best friends now, aren't we?
NPCStory_Love_RakeGrassbeardIntro |= Am getting old and have been in my shop for many years. At first, you hate the walls, and then you get used to them. Finally, you rely on them.
NPCStory_Love_RakeGrassbeardIntro |= I wish I was back on my first market stall. Summer was one fine season to be working outdoors.
NPCStory_Love_RakeGrassbeardIntro |= I suppose I should stick with tradition and give you some kind of task to seal our friendship?
NPCStory_Love_RakeGrassbeardIntro |= Well, let's make it easy for you. Just a couple of Hag's eyeballs will do. 
NPCStory_Love_RakeGrassbeardIntro |= Hags killed my parents, apparently. The sisters took a liking to them, and that was that.
NPCStory_Love_RakeGrassbeardOutro |= So you can be my revenge. I know you can take them.
NPCStory_Love_RakeGrassbeardOutro |= It's as the saying goes, 'Get busy killin' or get busy dyin'. 
NPCStory_Love_RakeGrassbeardOutro |= Doing a deed like that for a friend would prove you have what it takes. I am sure you can shank a Forest Hag easily.


NPCStory_Like_BettyScrumpyIntro |= Did you know that I used to be the best pastry chef in all Quill? Of course you didn't! Why would you? It's not like I go around telling anyone, you know. Anyway, I once entered a pie in the Bake Off.
NPCStory_Like_BettyScrumpyOutro |= They had to demolish the outhouse in Festfield afterwards.

NPCStory_Intro_LucyArrowsIntro |= Hello there! You just moved in with good old Bill, haven't you? Relatives, he said.
NPCStory_Intro_LucyArrowsIntro |= I'm Lucy, and I am the Vale's historian and researcher. I have a bit of a passion for learning all about our past and the Fae. I've seen them, you know?
NPCStory_Intro_LucyArrowsIntro |= It was a dark, rainy night...
NPCStory_Intro_LucyArrowsOutro |= Since then, I have tried to learn everything I can and even get that door to open, but to no avail. I shall keep trying, though!
NPCStory_Intro_LucyArrowsOutro |= Anyway, was good to meet you. Keep your eyes peeled!
