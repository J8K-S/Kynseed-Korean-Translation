WFIntroT1 |= 여기 있었구나!
WFIntroT2 |= 이쪽으로 와!
WeddingT1 |= We are here this day to unite two lovers under the Eyes of the Goddesses.
WeddingT2 |= Let there be peace in the winds.
WeddingT3 |= North, south, east and west.
WeddingT4 |= Under Goddesses fair, we bind these souls.
WeddingT5 |= Spirits of stone and mud.\nSpirits of Earth, Wind and Fire.
WeddingT7 |= Chase the clouds away and steal the night.
WeddingT8 |= With ringing hearts and singing souls.
WeddingT9 |= Come forth Gof, wielder of hammers!
WeddingT10 |= Come forth Cisson, purveyor of stars!
WeddingT11 |= Come forth Dian, healer of worlds!
WeddingT12 |= Come forth Suclus, Spirit of merriment.
WeddingT13 |= Come forth Bangais, protector and guardian.
WeddingT14 |= The ancients have given their blessing! May they aid this couple until death separates them.
WeddingT15 |= Now we unite you in eternal partnership.
WeddingT16 |= The tree bears a branch.\nThe branch bears a fruit.\nThe fruit bears a seed.\nThe seed enters the soil.
WeddingT17 |= The soil bears a tree.\nThe tree bears a branch.
WeddingT18 |= Unite now and complete the circle.\nThe Bands have been bound.
WeddingT19 |= The Words have been spoken.\nThe flame ignites.\nThe hearth is now lit.
FuneralT1 |= You believed in us.
FuneralT2 |= All we wanted was to make you proud.
FuneralT3 |= Perhaps you will both find each other in the woods and run together.
FuneralT4 |= I will join you one day.
FuneralT5 |= Thank you for everything you did for us.
FuneralT6 |= May the waters take you well.
FuneralT7 |= Goddesses bless you.
SummertideYear1T1 |= Welcome, good folk of the Vale. Summertide is here!
SummertideYear1T2 |= Huzzah
SummertideYear1T2 |= Hooray
SummertideYear1T2 |= Yay!
SummertideYear1T3 |= This glorious day is when Druida, Goddess of the Vale, stands above all others and opens Her arms to our humble offerings.
SummertideYear1T4 |= The day we celebrate the end of the Season of the Sun and ask for blessings so that we can taste the fruitful harvests.
SummertideYear1T5 |= Hail the Queen of the Orchard!
SummertideYear1T6 |= As Druida watches over us, Her love will bring growth, it will stave off hunger, it will protect us from disease and from the cold winters to come.
SummertideYear1T7 |= Now, let us speak the Summertide prayer.
SummertideYear1T8 |= Oh, Goddess of the orchards.
SummertideYear1T9 |= The tide of summer fades.
SummertideYear1T10 |= Bestow your fruits on us who offer our thanks.
SummertideYear1T11 |= We of Vale.
SummertideYear1T12 |= We of Quill.
SummertideYear1T13 |= We who bow to Druida's will.
SummertideYear1T14 |= The Seeds of Summertide step forth and prepare for the Choosing.
SummertideYear1T15 |= As you know, only one may present our tributes to Druida. Only one may be chosen for the greatest honour in the Vale.
SummertideYear1T16 |= Now, as is our custom, let the gaze of Druida fall upon the arbiter.
SummertideYear1T17 |= Druida has chosen one of the twins! Oh, glorious day! Tell us, child. Which one shall be our Summertide herald?
SummertideYear1T17Alt |= Druida has chosen! Oh, glorious day! Tell us, arbiter. Which one shall be our Summertide herald?
SummertideYear1T18 |= Huzzah
SummertideYear1T18 |= Hooray
SummertideYear1T18 |= Yay!
SummertideYear1T19 |= Very well! Step into the Woodfellow Herald! You leave this life a blessed soul, ready to take our offerings into Opal, where you will feel Druida's embrace!
SummertideYear1T20 |= Bathe in her purifying light! Oh, glory to the Goddess!
SummertideYear1T21 |= They're gone! And they made you choose! I don't believe it.
SummertideYear1T22 |= I thought things were going to be alright here, but everything he said was true.
SummertideYear1T23 |= They weren't just dreams...
UnwellOutroT1 |= You did it! Already, I feel so much better! It's like a huge weight of hatred has been lifted. Goddesses bless you. Please take this book as a reward. It tells you more about us folks of Woemarsh. You may find it insightful. Oh, joyous day!
JWWillowdownT1 |= Welcome home, dreaming one,\nThe quest for legend now is done.\nSlew the beast of hateful ire,\nCleansed its heart with purest fire.
JWWillowdownT2 |= I put its head with plenty care,\nIn the cellar over there.\nNow just relax until next needs,\nGrow your life as well as seeds.
JWWillowdownT3 |= Fairweather a happy bunny be,\nProud of you as you will see.\nYou can do whatever you want, my friend,\nI'll be with you til the end.
JWWillowdownT4 |= Legends made will carry on,\nTold in book and sang in song.\nThree cheers yes for you this day.\nPott says hip, and hip hooray!
SiblingOutsideTombT1 |= Is that... is that really you?!\nMy own sibling coming out of an ancient tomb looking like they've seen a ghost?!.\nHow have you been?\nYou've grown so much! Did you find anything in there?
SiblingOutsideTombT2 |= Well, that is incredible! Maybe this is a 'twin' thing, 'cause I have been in there too and was judged, just the same as you. I've spent all my free time exploring and have become rather good at it! The Mirryr made me a Master! Yes, that's right, your own twin, an actual Master of Exploration.
SiblingOutsideTombT3 |= I am thrilled you have incredible potential and your own mission. I always knew something was amiss about that place Toughwood. Everywhere I visited, there was this sense that its evil was creeping into our wider world. I live in Stonecrown, to the west, overlooking Toughwood. You can visit me anytime! I am actually duty-bound to help teach you about Exploration, should you fulfil my requirements, that is!
SiblingOutsideTombT4 |= Oh, and you might notice the big stone bridge in The Circle has been fixed. I got some good friends together, and we sorted it out. 
SiblingOutsideTombT5 |= I have to go now - a cat to feed. It was amazing to see you again. I am proud of you, and thank you for being proud of me too. What a duo! Take care, lazybones.
NPCFuneralOutlaneT1 |= We are gathered here to honour <VAR1>.\nWe commit their shell to the waters.
NPCFuneralOutlaneT2 |= Nature welcomes them back into the cycle of life.\nMay their transmutation bring joy to our world and happiness to them.
NPCFuneralOutlaneT3 |= Goddesses bless them.\nBless the Goddesses.
NPCFuneralOutlaneT4 |= Farewell, friend of all.\nMay the waters take you well.
NorthGateOpenT1 |= Tragedy and Fae dealings! Herbert knows such things. Herbert also knows what you seek. Now you are of age, you can pass the Gate and find it, yes you can!
NorthGateOpenT2 |= Seek The Circle! The world beyond waits, with adventure and danger! Herbert wishes you well. 
NorthGateOpenT3 |= If you need to protect yourself, seek Master Jogon in Rivermoor, just beyond this door. Now go, you must!
FrogmarshOpenT1 |= You have the means to cleanse the Unwell? Then I shall open the gate for you.
FrogmarshOpenT2 |= Be warned. You are about to enter Dreadwaters. Avoid HIM at all costs. The candles we placed everywhere keep HIM contained within. Do not let HIM get you. He only comes out when it is dark and the tomb opens. Take great care!
NorthGateNoiseT1 |= I tell you I saw it, yes I did! A poo the size of a pig!
NorthGateNoiseT2 |= Are you saying a monster is on the loose outside of the forests?
NorthGateNoiseT3 |= Yes yes yes! Herbert says exactly that!
NorthGateNoiseT4 |= I can't believe it for a...
NorthGateNoiseT5 |= What the actual flump was that?!
NorthGateNoiseT6 |= Herbert told you!
NorthGateNoiseT7 |= It was just thunder, I am sure. Yes, just thunder.
ParentDream2T1 |= Ahhh, home at last. I need to rest my feet and have a cup of berry juice.
ParentDream2T2 |= Yes, we walked a long way! You put your feet up, and I'll get us some refreshments.
ParentDream2T3 |= Hang on a moment! Is that what I think it is?!
ParentDream2T4 |= Oh my! It is! The Stork is delivering!
ParentDream2T5 |= Thank you, Mr Stork! Goddesses bless you! We have babies!
ParentDream2T6 |= Babies?!
ParentDream2T7 |= Twins! Yes! We have twins!
ParentDream1T1 |= Aha! Take a look at what I just found!
ParentDream1T2 |= Something exciting?
ParentDream1T3 |= It's a perfect Lover's Truffle. I can't believe it has been buried in our garden this whole time!
ParentDream1T4 |= Are you thinking what I am thinking? 
ParentDream1T5 |= I think I might be! Let's give it a go! Maybe this time we will strike it lucky and be blessed with a child!
ParentDream1T6 |= I really hope so!
SiblingMeetupT1 |= It's you! You came! It is so good to see you! Are you well?
SiblingMeetupT2 |= Look, I'm sorry if I seem excitable. It's just that I made a discovery, and I had to tell you straight away. Have you heard of the Grandmasters? Or The Circle to the east of here? There is this strange door there, set into the rock. I have been dreaming of that door more and more of late, so decided to do some research. My theory is that The Circle is where the actual Grandmasters lay buried. They were the ones who signed the Agreement and guard the Mirryr. There is a pad before the door that grants entry to those of high potential. I tried standing on it, but nothing happened. Perhaps you should try?
SiblingMeetupT3 |= I know we haven't seen each other since I left, and here I am, blathering on about ancient secrets! Let's go inside and catch up properly...
SiblingMeetupT4 |= So that's what you've been up to, eh? Well, it all sounds rather curious, so please take care. And be careful what you wish for!
SiblingMeetupT5 |= Oh my! Look at the time! My dandelion says I need to get on.
SiblingMeetupT6 |= It was great to see you. If you make any progress, let me know how it goes. And stay clear of Toughwood! That place gives me the chills. I am sure I am being watched by something there. I can feel hate seething in the air. My heart is strong, though. It won't get me!
SiblingMeetupT7 |= Take care of yourself, and see you again soon.
GrandmasterIntroT1 |= We are the three Grandmasters, guardians of the path to Opal, the home of the Goddesses. The stone door you just passed permits you to meet us, and as such, you are deemed worthy of looking into the Mirryr. 
GrandmasterIntroT2 |= Now, as you stand before us and gaze into the glass, we will see if you are worthy of Opal.
GrandmasterIntroT3 |= Something is wrong! How is it that you stand before us so soon? You have yet to perform great deeds! Yet the Goddesses would appear to see more in you than anyone else who has stood before us in this hall.
GrandmasterIntroT4 |= This is most unusual indeed, but the Mirryr has spoken to us. The message is clear that we three must guide you in a most important endeavour.
GrandmasterIntroT5 |= A legendary task awaits which will prove your worth to enter Opal.
GrandmasterIntroT6 |= I am The Wright. I was the one who forged the tools and weapons used during the war with the Fae. When the Agreement for peace was signed, I sacrificed my life so that my knowledge was bound between the two worlds and would never be lost or misused.
GrandmasterIntroT7 |= The task we have to give you is a long and difficult one.
GrandmasterIntroT8 |= An ancient creature from the darkest, deepest depths of Toughwood spreads pure hatred throughout Quill - the fearsome Jabberwock!
GrandmasterIntroT9 |= No mortal weapon can kill it. But the Vorpal Sword is the one blade that can pierce its dark heart.
GrandmasterIntroT10 |= Forged by my own hands long ago, the Sword can only be wielded by one of pure legend.
GrandmasterIntroT11 |= The original Sword was lost during the war, but the blacksmith's mould still exists, and the ore used to forge it can still be mined in the depths of the land. The Sword may only be wielded by a legend, though.
GrandmasterIntroT12 |= To become a legend, you must raise your Renown with us, the Grandmasters. 'Reputation' gained unlocks 'Renown' levels, granting you gifts that may aid your progress.
GrandmasterIntroT13 |= I am The Healer. Listen carefully to my words. Each of us has a unique gift for you for your adventures ahead.
GrandmasterIntroT14 |= I grant you the Reputation Urn. With this, you can collect REP, which is the currency that will fuel your rise to legendary status. Each store you own, each customer satisfied, each monster killed, and each task completed will grant you REP. Return here each time the Urn is filled, and we will gift you new items and your story will continue to unfold. Try starting with owning a store, and you'll soon be making fast progress collecting REP.
GrandmasterIntroT15 |= I am The Merchant. My gift to you is access to a magical book that, if used wisely, will make your businesses greater than any other in Quill. The Ledger will now sit on the counter of all businesses you visit. You can hire, fire, schedule, do accounts and gain perks within its pages.
GrandmasterIntroT16 |= Use it to purchase any business you desire.
GrandmasterIntroT17 |= My gift to you is less grand than the others but will prove just as helpful. I forged this long ago when I was lost and lonely. It is a Friendship Ring. When you gain friendships, it will give you more Friendship Points.
GrandmasterIntroT18 |= So, head off now and become the legend you are destined to be. Win the sword and slay the Jabberwock. Set Quill free from hatred.
GrandmasterIntroT19 |= Do this task for us, and you are one step closer to immortality and the prizes in the palace of the Goddess, Opal.
GrandmasterIntroT20 |= Farewell.
StonecrownJWT1 |= What a hero! You did it! You slew the Jabberwock, and now hatred is a thing of the past! I am so proud of you right now.
StonecrownJWT2 |= Teamwork makes the dream work, though, so I hope I get my name mentioned in the history books for my part.
StonecrownJWT3 |= Oh, glorious day! Go see those Grandmasters forthwith! Hurray!
CunningPlotsSceneT1 |= I told you already I'm not clearing this up.
CunningPlotsSceneT2 |= Well, it's not my mess! I saw you dumping it there just to stop me from getting into the village.
CunningPlotsSceneT3 |= Pah! Nonsense. You threw it all here to stop me sneakily using your windmill.
CunningPlotsSceneT4 |= Ah! So you admit it?!
CunningPlotsSceneT5 |= I did no such thing, nor did I pour glue into the grindstone.
CunningPlotsSceneT6 |= You just try that again and see how many pumpkins get filled up with fart gas.
CunningPlotsSceneT7 |= So that was you!
CunningPlotsSceneT8 |= I did no such thing!
CunningPlotsSceneT9 |= Did too! Anyway, I am not clearing up this mess.
CunningPlotsSceneT10 |= Well, I am sure some sucker will come along and clear it up. There's always one do-gooder.
CunningPlotsSceneT11 |= True, that.
TwangingTotemsIntroT1 |= Aha! There they are!
TwangingTotemsIntroT2 |= I am not coming out til that thing is gone! Please help!
TwangingTotemsIntroT3 |= Those two have been coming out of the forest and causing bother, and now they have a new toy. I wonder who gave them that?
TwangingTotemsIntroT4 |= See those rifts? I've seen them before over in Homesteads. A powerful force stopped me from getting too close, but these look the same. Maybe you could try and investigate? Be prepared for trouble, though!
TwangingTotemsIntroT5 |= The whole set-up seems to attract Hobs and Lobs to the area they appear in. The blighters ravage the region of all its goods. My best guess is that you must clear those rifts and then destroy the Totem! \nPerhaps the Hobs will go too and leave us all in peace.
NPCStory_Like_EdnaTeapottT1 |= Did you know I used to be married to Ignatius?
NPCStory_Like_EdnaTeapottT2 |= I love you.
NPCStory_Like_EdnaTeapottT3 |= I love you too.
NPCStory_Like_EdnaTeapottT4 |= Then a young couple moved in, Edward and Holly, and let's just say it got a bit messy.
NPCStory_Like_EdnaTeapottT5 |= We must keep this secret.
NPCStory_Like_EdnaTeapottT6 |= They can't find out.
NPCStory_Like_EdnaTeapottT7 |= Before you knew it, we had swapped partners.
NPCStory_Like_EdnaTeapottT8 |= I'm leaving you.
NPCStory_Like_EdnaTeapottT9 |= The spirit of love has moved on.
NPCStory_Like_EdnaTeapottT10 |= This was meant to be.
NPCStory_Like_EdnaTeapottT11 |= We fit like a jigsaw.
NPCStory_Like_ArthurBrownT1 |= I was in some sort of cave, and all the animals I had ever eaten were there, and they asked me to bite into them. Each was, like, competing to be the tastiest.
NPCStory_Like_ArthurBrownT2 |= Hey, Arthur, fancy a nibble?
NPCStory_Like_ArthurBrownT3 |= My meat is very tender.
NPCStory_Like_ArthurBrownT4 |= Come have a bite, Arthur.
NPCStory_Like_ArthurBrownT5 |= You ate us before. Where's the harm?
MusicFestivalT1 |= What's up ghosts?! Who is ready to rock til they drop dead again? Who is ready to party like it's 5999? Here they are! The legends returned from the dead, although they are actually still dead.
MusicFestivalT2 |= They are here to exorcise you... put your transparent hands in the air for Thunderblast Exorcism!
MusicFestivalT3 |= Yeah!
MusicFestivalT3 |= I'm ready!
MusicFestivalT3 |= My body is missing, but I am ready!
MusicFestivalT3 |= Bring it on! 
MusicFestivalT3 |= Ye shall rock me!
MusicFestivalT3 |= None more see-through!
MusicFestivalT3 |= Is that Fae henge 18 inches tall?
MusicFestivalT3 |= Loving it!
MusicFestivalT3 |= Exorcise me!
MusicFestivalT3 |= Yeah!
MusicFestivalT3 |= Rocking like a comfy chair!
MusicFestivalT3 |= I'm comfortably dead.
MusicFestivalT3 |= Woooooo!
MusicFestivalT3 |= Right on!
MusicFestivalT3 |= This is lifting my spirits!
MusicFestivalT3 |= We built this village on rock and roll.
MusicFestivalT3 |= For those about to rot!
MusicFestivalT3 |= Ride the lightning... again!
MusicFestivalT4 |= We rock!
MusicFestivalT5 |= That was spiritual!
MusicFestivalT6 |= We are Thunderblast Exorcism! Thank you, everybody and have a good afterlife!
MusicFestivalT7 |= That was just the best thing ever. My earwax literally melted! Na-na-na nananananananan!
MusicFestivalT8 |= See you around, cool dude. Too cool to be a dud.
GrandmasterTier9SiblingT2 |= I was told you might be down here. I decided to follow you here and to quietly listen in, so here I am. I will congratulate you properly on your amazing Renown later.
GrandmasterTier9SiblingT3 |= Meteoryt eh? I know it is a very hard rock to find. Hmmm, let me think a little...
GrandmasterTier9SiblingT4 |= Hmmmm, I wonder...
GrandmasterTier9SiblingT5 |= Do you know anyone at all who is an expert on hard rocks?
NPCStory_Friendly_HazelNuttT1 |= I thought he would lift me on his shoulders to touch the stars.
NPCStory_Friendly_HazelNuttT2 |= Oooh, an apple!
NPCStory_Friendly_HazelNuttT3 |= All he did was eat fruit and sit reading on the toilet.
NPCStory_Friendly_HazelNuttT4 |= I'll be another half hour, yet.
NPCStory_Friendly_HazelNuttT5 |= Going to be a while longer. This book is engrossing.
NPCStory_Friendly_HazelNuttT6 |= Are you still in there?
NPCStory_Friendly_HazelNuttT7 |= Hello?
NPCStory_Friendly_HazelNuttT8 |= Hugh?
NPCStory_Love_TheresaBrownT1 |= Arthur!
NPCStory_Love_TheresaBrownT2 |= I don't know where these chops came from! Honest!
NPCStory_Love_TheresaBrownT3 |= How could you?! We're vegetarians!
NPCStory_Love_TheresaBrownT4 |= I'm so weak! I just needed something substantial! Something meaty!
NPCStory_Love_TheresaBrownT5 |= I'm so sorry!
NPCStory_Love_PatCoweT1 |= Peppy! Will you stop running around like a blue-arsed fly and behave?!
NPCStory_Love_PatCoweT2 |= Soz pops
NPCStory_Love_PatCoweT3 |= *Trickle*
NPCStory_Love_PatCoweT4 |= B'gger!
NPCStory_Like_BettyScrumpyT1 |= My pastry, well, let me tell you, my pastry was lighter than a ghost butterfly! It's just a pity I mistakenly used Gassy Apples rather than regular apples for the filling.
NPCStory_Like_BettyScrumpyT2 |= <anim_wave>*Parp*
NPCStory_Like_BettyScrumpyT3 |= <anim_wave>*Toot*
NPCStory_Like_BettyScrumpyT4 |= <anim_wave>*Barooom*
NPCStory_Like_BettyScrumpyT5 |= <anim_wave>*Frrrp*
NPCStory_Like_BettyScrumpyT6 |= <anim_wave>*Toot*
NPCStory_Like_BettyScrumpyT7 |= <anim_wave>*Parp*
NPCStory_Like_BettyScrumpyT8 |= <anim_wave>*Honk*
NPCStory_Like_TomCoweT1 |= Whistle while you work. Doop di doo
NPCStory_Like_TomCoweT2 |= Hmmm, wonder if I will strike it rich today
NPCStory_Like_TomCoweT3 |= What's that tapping?
NPCStory_Like_EdwardWoodT1 |= Do you have to go?
NPCStory_Like_EdwardWoodT2 |= It's only fair. You got to go last time.
NPCStory_Like_EdwardWoodT3 |= Indeed, but that was only Simplewood. You are talking about Toughwood here.
NPCStory_Like_EdwardWoodT4 |= It's not as bad as they say, I am sure. If Gertrude Signal can come out of there, so can I.
NPCStory_Like_EdwardWoodT5 |= I just have a bad feeling...
NPCStory_Like_EdwardWoodT6 |= That's probably your cooking. Now, watch Daisy while I go sharpen my sword, please.
NPCStory_Like_EdwardWoodT7 |= If anything happens to her, I will always be there for you, my little gooseberry
NPCStory_Like_EdwardWoodT8 |= If only you had listened. A pointless passing, just to prove yourself. You never had to prove anything, my love.
NPCStory_Love_RogerReadilyT1 |= Was that it? That was as exciting as watching someone paint a house with a palette swap.
NPCStory_Love_RogerReadilyT2 |= Where can it be?
NPCStory_Like_PoppySeedT1 |= There was an old hermit called Love, Who lived in my heart like a dove...
NPCStory_Like_PoppySeedT2 |= There is an inn, a merry old inn, beneath an old green hill. 
NPCStory_Like_PoppySeedT3 |= There, we avoided copyright infringement...
NPCStory_Like_PoppySeedT4 |= Terrible!
NPCStory_Like_PoppySeedT5 |= Sing us something we know.
NPCStory_Like_PoppySeedT6 |= Can't even dance to it.
NPCStory_Like_PoppySeedT7 |= Booooo!
NPCStory_Like_NerysNailT1 |= Ohhh! I love this one!
NPCStory_Like_NerysNailT2 |= Beautiful! Such amazing colours!
NPCStory_Like_NerysNailT3 |= Oh my! It veritably pops!
NPCStory_Like_NerysNailT4 |= What an amazingly deep brown!
NPCStory_Love_DickTurnipT1 |= I am so sad today! My beard is wiry, and my bottom doesn't scare the fish.
NPCStory_Love_DickTurnipT2 |= My wings don't shimmer today. It makes me feel reaaaaaally blue
NPCStory_Love_DickTurnipT3 |= Oh, piffle my poffles! He'd rather sit on a mushroom than take me shopping
NPCStory_Love_DickTurnipT4 |= HAHAHA!
NPCStory_Love_DickTurnipT5 |= LOOK AT IT DANCE!
NPCStory_Love_DickTurnipT6 |= WOO! I NEEDED THAT TODAY
NPCStory_FriendlyEunLivingstunT1 |= You are in a cave chamber. To exit, turn to page 35.
NPCStory_FriendlyEunLivingstunT2 |= You are in a cave chamber. To exit, turn to page 231.
NPCStory_FriendlyEunLivingstunT3 |= You are in a cave chamber. To exit, turn to page 101.
NPCStory_FriendlyEunLivingstunT4 |= Whoever writes mazes in these books is a sadist!
NPCStory_Like_FroggHermitT1 |= Father. Did that necklace you sold that man really make you invulnerable to fire?
NPCStory_Like_FroggHermitT2 |= Of course, son, why?
NPCStory_Like_FroggHermitT3 |= Well, it looks just like the necklace you sold that other lady which makes you fly, and we found her at the bottom of a cliff, all flat.
NPCStory_Like_FroggHermitT4 |= She obviously did not read the instructions.
NPCStory_Like_FroggHermitT5 |= You gave her a piece of paper saying flap your arms and become the hawk
NPCStory_Like_FroggHermitT6 |= *AAAAGGGHHH*
NPCStory_Like_FroggHermitT7 |= Dad, that man you just sold that necklace to has set himself on fire
NPCStory_Like_FroggHermitT8 |= I see that, son. Now shut up, ready the cart and let us hastily get out of here.
NPCStory_Like_MoLawnT1 |= I would do anything for love
NPCStory_Like_MoLawnT2 |= Would you fight a horde of vicious Hobs?
NPCStory_Like_MoLawnT3 |= Yes. I would do anything for love
NPCStory_Like_MoLawnT4 |= Would you dance with the Fae in the pale moonlight and give them your life force so that I could remain young?
NPCStory_Like_MoLawnT5 |= Yes, I would do anything for love.
NPCStory_Like_MoLawnT6 |= Would you eat my homecooked meatloaf?
NPCStory_Like_MoLawnT7 |= I would do anything for love, but I won't do that.
NPCStory_Friendly_StarSapphireT1 |= You are such an inspiration, Star, my love.
NPCStory_Friendly_StarSapphireT2 |= I wrote this song just for you, the greatest person in the whole universe.
NPCStory_Friendly_StarSapphireT3 |= She's got hair of the pinkest pink
NPCStory_Friendly_StarSapphireT4 |= Reminds me of childhood... candy hares
NPCStory_Friendly_StarSapphireT5 |= Where everything shined like the Voidian skyyyy
NPCStory_Friendly_StarSapphireT6 |= Now and then, when I see her gaze
NPCStory_Friendly_StarSapphireT7 |= I fall into a... purple haze
NPCStory_Friendly_StarSapphireT8 |= And if I stare too long, I'd probably break down and cryyyy
NPCStory_Friendly_StarSapphireT9 |= Woooahh Ohhh sweet Star Sapphire!
NPCStory_Like_RavenLoonT1 |= And then the door creaked open slowly...
NPCStory_Like_RavenLoonT2 |= Ooooh! What then?
NPCStory_Like_RavenLoonT3 |= There was a flash of lightning, and stood in the doorway was Old Bob.
NPCStory_Like_RavenLoonT4 |= Go on! Did he have an axe ready to chop her head off?
NPCStory_Like_RavenLoonT5 |= Noooo! Old Bob stepped into the candlelight, and she saw he was holding...
NPCStory_Like_RavenLoonT6 |= A cleaver? A severed head?
NPCStory_Like_RavenLoonT7 |= A SAUSAGE!
NPCStory_Like_RavenLoonT8 |= Eh?
NPCStory_Like_RavenLoonT9 |= But not any old sausage! It was the sausage of death!
NPCStory_Like_RavenLoonT10 |= He killed her with it?
NPCStory_Like_RavenLoonT11 |= No. It was a sausage that had been badly overcooked.
NPCStory_Like_RavenLoonT12 |= You really need to work on your stories, Lewis.
NPCStory_Friendly_NedScrumpyT1 |=  Next customer, please!
NPCStory_Friendly_NedScrumpyT2 |=  I'd like one of your incredible golden shovels, please.
NPCStory_Friendly_NedScrumpyT3 |=  How may I serve you this day?
NPCStory_Friendly_NedScrumpyT4 |=  I just want to buy ALL the goods!
NPCStory_Friendly_NedScrumpyT5 |=  What seems to be the problem today?
NPCStory_Friendly_NedScrumpyT6 |=  I have a boil on my...
Day6PicnicT1 |= This is such a beautiful spot for a picnic. Happy birthday, Uncle Bill! We really appreciate you taking us in.
Day6PicnicT2 |= Oh, that's ok! It's wonderful to have you both around. Makes days like this extra special.
Day6PicnicT3 |= I used to come to this spot with your Auntie Rose. The sound of waterfalls made her nod off almost instantly. That meant I could eat more of the picnic!
Day6PicnicT4 |= What happened to her, Uncle Bill?
Day6PicnicT5 |= I-I can't really talk about it. I miss her every day, and what happened still churns my stomach every single time I think about it.
Day6PicnicT6 |= Oh. I am so sorry, Uncle Bill.
Day6PicnicT7 |= Oh, that's ok! Brrrrr, let's forget all that, shall we, and concentrate on this lovely food, fine location and wonderful company.
Day6PicnicT8 |= Now, I have a question about that Shoe you lived in...
Day6PicnicT9 |= I'm sure I saw a nugget of gold in this pond!
Day6PicnicT10 |= Hmmm. Be careful. Could be a young Cointail or, worse, a Merkin.
Day6PicnicT11 |= What's a Merkin?
Day6PicnicT12 |= Nasty little Fae that entice you to reach in to grab the gold, hoping you fall in so they can eat your hair!
Day6PicnicT13 |= That's horrible!
Day6PicnicT14 |= Well, if my dandelion is on the ball, then the time is hometime! Let's pack up and get going.
Day6PicnicT15 |= It's been a great afternoon and birthday, thank you. 
Day6PicnicT16 |= Huzzah! See you back at the house, lazybones!
RootmotherIntroT1 |= Hmmmmm. Who are you? Are you one of my children? You look too soft to be one of mine.
RootmotherIntroT2 |= Where are they all? Are they hiding behind you? Oh, deary deary me. My children have run off again! They are such naughty little sprouts.
RootmotherIntroT3 |= Could you help an old lady out and look for them for me?
RootmotherIntroT4 |= I am the Rootmother, and my Green Children usually play close to me until they become fully grown.
RootmotherIntroT5 |= You might find them here and there, in this realm or yours. Such naughty sprouts!
RootmotherIntroT6 |= Find all ten, if you can. Then, I shall reward you, soft one.
RootmotherIntroT7 |= Oh, those naughty sprouts. Zzzzzzzz.
NPCStory_Intro_MelanieJuggT1 |= 언젠가 이 모든 것이 너의 것이 될 거다. 모든 숙성된 술통. 폭행당한 모든 의자. 술로 얼룩진 테이블. 톱밥 한 톨도 내가 자연으로 돌아가면 모두 너의 것이야.
NPCStory_Intro_MelanieJuggT2 |= 대신 유니콘을 주면 안 돼요, 아빠?
NPCStory_Intro_MelanieJuggT3 |= 호 호! 재밌구나! 진짜 유니콘이라. 물론, 이 펍의 이름을 유니콘으로 바꾼다면 모를까, 그렇지 않다면 불가능하겠지!
NPCStory_Intro_MelanieJuggT4 |= 무슨 냄새예요, 아빠?
NPCStory_Intro_MelanieJuggT5 |= 행복한 사람들과 좋은 환호의 냄새지! 좋은 술. 좋은 동료. 좋은 노래.
NPCStory_Intro_MelanieJuggT6 |= 병든 냄새가 나요, 아빠.
NPCStory_Intro_MelanieJuggT7 |= 숨을 들이마셔 보렴! 이게 바로 행복의 냄새야!
NPCStory_Intro_MelanieJuggT8 |= 너무 웃겨요, 아빠.
NPCStory_Intro_MelanieJuggT9 |= 익숙해질 거다. 자, 그럼 아침 먹기 전에 한 잔 마셔야겠군. 코를 따뜻하게 하려면말이야...
NPCStory_Like_LewisFlushingT1 |= I wish I could fly way into the sky, but I can't.
NPCStory_Like_LewisFlushingT2 |= You can, Lewis.
NPCStory_Like_LewisFlushingT3 |= I can't
NPCStory_Like_LewisFlushingT4 |= Lewis! Your dinner is ready! Lewisssss!
NPCStory_Like_LewisFlushingT5 |= Coming, mother!
NPCStory_Love_JacobCrackleT1 |= Is that what I think it is? Oh, well, light my wick and call me a candle! It's Mag the Moghog! Here in Cuckoo Wood!
NPCStory_Love_JacobCrackleT2 |= You get some sleep, you majestic creature...
NPCStory_Love_RakeGrassbeardT1 |= I'm sorry mum. I'm sorry Dad. I should have been here to help you. I would have killed those Hags.
NPCStory_Love_RakeGrassbeardT2 |= I just wanted you to be proud of me for helping out at the market. I should have been at home to protect you both.
NPCStory_Love_RakeGrassbeardT3 |= The Hags won't get away with this, I swear.

ParentDream3T1 |= Get back, beast!
ParentDream3T2 |= AAAGGGHH! It's got me, Maeve! Its teeth, so sharp...
ParentDream3T3 |= Alun! Someone, please help us!
ParentDream3T4 |= Nooo - Alun! It's got me. Someone help me! Its claws, so long...
ParentDream3T5 |= Those screams! The terrible monster has struck again!
ParentDream3T6 |= Waahhhh!
ParentDream3T7 |= Woohhhh!
ParentDream3T8 |= The horror! What a terrible way to die! We need to get you two children to safety straight away. Oh, you poor little souls. Well, I am too old to look after you, but I know a very kind lady who can. Come here, you poor little mites. Let's get you safe.

RootmotherOutroT1 |= Hmmm? Hmmmmm? HMMMM!
RootmotherOutroT2 |= My sprouts! Oh, you little darlings! You have been found.
RootmotherOutroT3 |= You have shown a tremendous kindness, soft one.
RootmotherOutroT4 |= A gift I give to you, yes? Let me see what I have in my roots...
RootmotherOutroT5 |= Hmmm, perhaps this may be of use? Someone hid it in a tree hollow in your realm once.
RootmotherOutroT6 |= My roots touch all soft one.
RootmotherOutroT7 |= Now, children, say thank you to the kind soft one, and do not run off again my naughty little sprouts!
Day9DreamT1 |= We know you. We can see your potential. Become who you were born to be. Join us, and the universe will be yours to explore.
Day9DreamT2 |= Time will bend itself to your every whim. Quill will be yours to shine upon like the stars.
Day9DreamT3 |= We will be watching you. Watching. Look deep into the Mirryr and find us...
NedDay14T1 |= You lucky hare! You got to choose the Herald! I just had to come and say well done.
NedDay14T2 |= I saw that <VAR1> was upset, but they will come around. It is just how things are.
NedDay14T3 |= I would love to be a Herald one day. It is the greatest honour. I would love to see inside Opal.
NedDay14T4 |= Anyway just wanted to say that everyone is proud of you, and I see you in a new light.
NedDay14T5 |= Best get off, evening time. There's a bit of a strange look to the sky tonight, but I have a good feeling about it.
NedDay14T6 |= Take care!
NPCStory_Intro_LucyArrowsT1 |= This way, oh hi, oh hi
NPCStory_Intro_LucyArrowsT2 |= What in Quill is that?! Coming through that door?
NPCStory_Intro_LucyArrowsT3 |= Oh, hi.
NPCStory_Intro_LucyArrowsT4 |= Oh hi.
NPCStory_Intro_LucyArrowsT5 |= It's off to shop to buy.
LucyArrowsStoryOutroT1 |= Oh my! It's a Gnome! A real-life little Gnome! It is an honour to meet you! My name is Lucy Arrows.
LucyArrowsStoryOutroT2 |= I have so many questions!
LucyArrowsStoryOutroT3 |= ... that all sounds really bizarre. Almost like you made it up. Are you sure you are a legitimate Gnome, not just a short old guy in a hat?
LucyArrowsStoryOutroT4 |= Anyway, thanks for the chat. I think my Gnome obsession has been quenched!
PottAdultIntroT1 |= Welcome home, dreaming one,\nName is Pott, recall our fun?

PottAdultIntroT3 |= Lost your kin, but don't be glum,\nA legacy is yet-to-come.
PottAdultIntroT4 |= The farm is yours and I your friend,\nWill dust the hearth and beds to mend.
PottAdultIntroT5 |= What next for you, I would guess?\nYou've seen the door, so seek it yes?

PottAdultIntroT8 |= And also build those ties that last, \nWith Friends & Family to help with task.
PottAdultIntroT9 |= But first, you have the Kynseed gotten,\nPlant it now lest it be rotten.
PottAdultIntroT10 |= Grow the tree and roots so deep,\nA legacy that will f'rever keep.
KynseedPlantingT1 |= Kynseed planted! Oh joyous time!\nNow listen to my little rhyme.
KynseedPlantingT2 |= Seek Master Jogon, past the gate,\nWhere you find that Herbert waits.
KynseedPlantingT3 |= The Master will teach an important skill,\nThe art of blades and how to kill.
KynseedPlantingT4 |= After that, he'll point the way,\nSo b'gger off! Be on yer way!
PottINTRO |= What next for you, I would guess?\nYou've seen the door, so seek it yes?\nNorth Gate beckons, and the world outside,\nAdventures many and pigs to ride.
