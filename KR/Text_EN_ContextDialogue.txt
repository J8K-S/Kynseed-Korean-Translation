CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_WEALTH_POOR |= I wish we had more money.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_WEALTH_POOR |= You need to try to earn more.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_WEALTH_POOR |= I keep dreaming we swim in Brass.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_WEALTH_POOR |= We are a bit short of money lately.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_WEALTH_POOR |= We have to do better.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_WEALTH_POOR |= I want a spouse who can earn their Brass.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_WEALTH_GETTINGBY |= This is the life. Getting cosily by in our own place.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_WEALTH_GETTINGBY |= I feel we can really get somewhere in life.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_WEALTH_GETTINGBY |= Having some money is nice.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_WEALTH_GETTINGBY |= A nice farm. A bit of brass. High hopes!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_WEALTH_GETTINGBY |= Ahh, the simple life.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_WEALTH_WEALTHY |= I love being rich.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_WEALTH_WEALTHY |= The problem with having so much money is that you want more.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_WEALTH_WEALTHY |= Could you buy me something nice? We have enough money!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_WEALTH_WEALTHY |= Money talks. Not literally.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_WEALTH_WEALTHY |= I never dreamed I would be married to a money machine.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_WEALTH_WEALTHY |= Do you think I am a gold-digger?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_WEALTH_WEALTHY |= Money is funny in a rich man's world.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_WEALTH_WEALTHY |= Nice Brass, shame about the face. Just kidding.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_WEALTH_WEALTHY |= I love that I am rich. I mean we.

CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_GENERAL |= This is nice.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_GENERAL |= Can't beat a nice bit of relaxing.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_GENERAL |= I like a bit of time to myself.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_GENERAL |= Ahhhh, nice and relaxing.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_GENERAL |= I like being alone with my thoughts.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_GENERAL |= Just gazing at the sky...
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_GENERAL |= Nice to be able to unwind.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_GENERAL |= Goddesses bless, winds caress, rest and slumber, strong as lumber.

CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_GENERAL_NEUTRAL |= Alright?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_GENERAL_NEUTRAL |= Oh, you again.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_GENERAL_NEUTRAL |= Am well, thanks for asking.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_GENERAL_NEUTRAL |= After the love has gone, how can we carry on?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_GENERAL_NEUTRAL |= Hmmmph.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_GENERAL_NEUTRAL |= Oh, it's you.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_GENERAL_NEUTRAL |= Hope you are getting off your arse and doing something.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_GENERAL_NEUTRAL |= Oh it's you.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_GENERAL_DISLIKE |= Uggghh.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_GENERAL_DISLIKE |= Seeing your face makes me wish it was pitch dark.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_GENERAL_DISLIKE |= Leave me alone.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_GENERAL_DISLIKE |= Don't bother talking to me.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_GENERAL_DISLIKE |= Back again? Pity.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_GENERAL_DISLIKE |= Can't you go to Toughwood and get eaten?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_GENERAL_DISLIKE |= Hanging around like flies on a cowpat?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_GENERAL_DISLIKE |= Hrrrmmph.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_GENERAL_DISLIKE |= I think I found a nit. It's you!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_ACTIVITY_FARMING |= Just tenderly tending.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_ACTIVITY_FARMING |= Just letting you know I am talking about the crops to give context.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_ACTIVITY_FARMING |= Lovely growth.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_ACTIVITY_FARMING |= The soil here is so brown.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_ACTIVITY_FARMING |= With love and care, the crop ain't bare.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_ACTIVITY_FARMING |= Summer is coming in, loudly sing cuckoo.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_ACTIVITY_FARMING |= Sickle and hoe, grow wheat grow.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_ACTIVITY_PETS |= Oh, look at your fur!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_ACTIVITY_PETS |= You are so soft.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_ACTIVITY_PETS |= Hungry little one?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_ACTIVITY_PETS |= A stroke as gentle as a feather...

CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_ACTIVITY_PETS |= Such a wee little thing you are.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_ACTIVITY_PETS |= So loyal!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_ACTIVITY_GET_HONEY |= Hello Mr Bee, have some honey for me?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_ACTIVITY_GET_HONEY |= Honey is as sweet as can be.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_ACTIVITY_GET_HONEY |= So sticky!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_ACTIVITY_GET_HONEY |= Fill a jar, and you'll go far.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_ACTIVITY_GET_HONEY |= Just collecting some sweet nectar, my friends.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_ACTIVITY_GET_HONEY |= Buzz off!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_ACTIVITY_GET_HONEY |= I just got stung by a bee... for 10 Brass!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_SPOUSE_ACTIVITY_GET_HONEY |= Bee hive yourselves.

CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_JUST_MARRIED_BAD |= Glad that wasn't me marrying you!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_JUST_MARRIED_BAD |= Unlucky for your spouse!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_JUST_MARRIED_BAD |= Hmmph. Who'd marry you?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_JUST_MARRIED_BAD |= Bad luck be on your marriage!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_JUST_MARRIED_BAD |= Ha! It won't last!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_JUST_MARRIED_BAD |= Am shocked anyone would marry you.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_JUST_MARRIED_BAD |= A curse on your marriage!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_JUST_MARRIED_BAD |= I really couldn't care less!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_JUST_MARRIED_BAD |= Congratulations? No thanks.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_JUST_MARRIED_BAD |= You married? So what?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_GOOD_POSITIVE |= Happily married still, I see!

CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_GOOD_POSITIVE |= Nice to see you both happy.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_GOOD_NEGATIVE |= Sad to see you so happy!

CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_GOOD_NEGATIVE |= A happy marriage is for suckers.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_GOOD_NEGATIVE |= Oh. Still married happily, unfortunately.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_GOOD_NEGATIVE |= No idea why your spouse is still with you.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_GOOD_NEGATIVE |= How does your spouse put up with you?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_GOOD_NEGATIVE |= Is your spouse blind AND stupid?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_GOOD_NEGATIVE |= How can your spouse not smell you and leave?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_BAD_POSITIVE |= Sad to see you both struggling.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_BAD_POSITIVE |= I thought you would both be happy longer.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_BAD_POSITIVE |= You should talk things over with your spouse.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_BAD_POSITIVE |= Please heal your marriage.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_BAD_POSITIVE |= For your happiness, divorce, or fix it!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_BAD_POSITIVE |= Marriage not going well?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_BAD_POSITIVE |= Sorry to hear your love life is fading.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_BAD_POSITIVE |= Is the sun going down on wedded bliss?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_BAD_NEGATIVE |= Marriage bad? Haha!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_BAD_NEGATIVE |= I knew it wouldn't last.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_BAD_NEGATIVE |= Spouse finally woke up, eh?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_BAD_NEGATIVE |= You should divorce and marry a fish.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_BAD_NEGATIVE |= Happy to see you so sad.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_BAD_NEGATIVE |= Couldn't happen to a worse person.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_BAD_NEGATIVE |= Relationship on the rocks like your brains eh?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_BAD_NEGATIVE |= Spouse saw the light finally!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_MARRIED_BAD_NEGATIVE |= Sad to see your love life suffering. Not really.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_RAINING |= Raining again!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_RAINING |= Ah, rain. I needed a wash.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_RAINING |= Ey oop! Raining!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_RAINING |= Rain rain go away.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_RAINING |= It's that fine rain that soaks you through.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_RAINING |= It's spittin'!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_RAINING |= Bit of rain hurt nobody. Except witches.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_SNOWING |= Bit of snow hurt nobody. Except witches allergic to snow.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_SNOWING |= Snow joke!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_SNOWING |= Every flake is unique, like my warts.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_SNOWING |= Ahhh, the tingle of snow on my nose.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_SNOWING |= It is snowing. Obvious flavour text!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_SNOWING |= Snowflakes are like my dandruff.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_SNOWING |= What a bunch of snowflakes.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_SNOWING |= Need to sit by a hearthstone in this blizzard.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= I can't see fertiliser.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= I mist my turn off!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= It's a real leek souper.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= Who goes there?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= Am I even on the right road here?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= It's pretty murky out!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= I can't see anything.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= I need to get myself a horn.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= Mister Mist, go away!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= It's a foggy compo to find Clegg.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= Gone but not fog-otten.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= Dragon's breath!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= Watch yourself in this fog!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= Mind your step!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= Aurore's farts it's foggy out!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= This is spooky.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= Fog chills your spine.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= Carpenters love a good fog.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= Stephen was king of the mist
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_MIST |= Fog off!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= I think I set my socks on fire.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= I am having brainpoops.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= What was I saying to myself just then?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= This fog is as thick as I feel.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= Which way wasn't I going?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= I've forgotten more than you know.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= Who am I again?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= Hey, look! It's... erm... shapes?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= Is it just me, or is everyone stupid today?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= I could charm the horse off a shoe today.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= Can't see much in that fog. Nor think much.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= I just thought up an equation. I think it's a type of newt.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= I would forget my own head if it weren't nailed on with string.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= My head feels as empty as my larder.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= What was I walking this way for?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= Oh dear, I put my underwear on upside down.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= What... is... ummm... thingy?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= I wouldn't look in my brain today. Nothing down there.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= It's this thick fog that soaks your brain through.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= Am I being dumb or am I just being dumb?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= It's obvious 2 plus 2 equals 22.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= This fog is about as dense as me.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= I would happily buy a straw hammer today.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= My IQ is easily about 14, and I don't know what IQ is.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= Did someone just walk off with my brain today?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= I can spell every word beginning with 7.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= I think I forgot to go to the toilet just now.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= A person could get lost in this, erm, frog? Fob?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_WEATHER_THICKFOG |= I couldn't charm the ears off an eel right now.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_RIDING_PIG |= Be careful with that thing.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_RIDING_PIG |= Have you passed your pig riding proficiency test?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_RIDING_PIG |= Ride carefully!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_RIDING_PIG |= Look at that pig fly!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_RIDING_PIG |= Trot along!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_RIDING_PIG |= That pig smells of pepper.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_RIDING_PIG |= Woah there!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_RIDING_PIG |= Streaky bacon!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_PLAYER_FISHING |= Anything biting?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_PLAYER_FISHING |= Catch us a winner.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_PLAYER_FISHING |= Any nibbles?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_PLAYER_FISHING |= There's one!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_PLAYER_FISHING |= Big ones in there.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_PLAYER_FISHING |= You are doing it all wrong.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_PLAYER_FISHING |= Supper ahoy!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_PLAYER_FISHING |= Something fishy going on here.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_PLAYER_FISHING |= Catch owt?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_PLAYER_FISHING |= Caught anything good?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_PLAYER_FISHING |= Ahhh, can't beat a bit of angling.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_ARMY |= Well, smash my conkers! What a sight!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_ARMY |= You and whose pet army? What's an army anyway?

CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_CAT |= Achoo!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_CAT |= That cat has weird eyes.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_CAT |= Makes me want a new pet.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_CAT |= Look at that! A cat!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_CAT |= I seem to be reacting to that cat.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_CAT |= Awww, fluffy!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_DOG |= Don't dig up my garden!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_DOG |= Make sure you clean up after that!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_DOG |= Awww, nice doggy.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_DOG |= What a nice dog.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_DOG |= Four legs looks like fun.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_DOG |= Don't you dare hump my leg.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_DOG |= Off adventuring together?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_DOG |= Well, I'll be dog-gone.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_DOG |= Woof to you too.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_DOG |= Sniffed up any treasure?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_DOG |= Good doggie.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_PIG |= Reminds me. I need more bacon.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_PIG |= Awww, cute piggle.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_PIG |= Nice piggy.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_PIG |= That pig must love you!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_PIG |= Is that one a good racer?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_PIG |= Hamazing!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_PIG |= You don't see that every day. Well, you sort of do.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_CHICKEN |= Chicken chasing!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_CHICKEN |= Looks like something from an old fable.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_CHICKEN |= Cluck to it!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_CHICKEN |= What an eggscellent sight.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_CHICKEN |= Clucking funny seeing that.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_CHICKEN |= Awww, sort of cute chicken.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_CHICKEN |= Go to work on an egg-layer.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_CHICKEN |= That's funny to see.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_CHICKEN |= Look at its little legs go.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_CHICKEN |= Fowl play!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_OWL |= Nice bird!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_OWL |= That better not poo on my windows.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_OWL |= In a flap?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_OWL |= Look at that!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_OWL |= Am I dreaming, or is that owl made of twigs?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_OWL |= Is that parrot cosplaying?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_OWL |= Now THAT'S a pet!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_OWL |= That beak looks sharp.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_OWL |= Does it do tricks?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_OWL |= Is your owl called Russell?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_OWL |= Keep that away from my goldfish.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_OWL |= I had a mechanical owl once.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_OWL |= Strange animal!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_OWL |= Is that a legendary Filifryth?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_OWL |= Show off!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_OWL |= I want one of those.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_ANIMAL_FOLLOWING_OWL |= What does it do?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SHOP_OWNED |= Bought a shop, eh? Good luck with that.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SHOP_OWNED |= You must be in the money to own a business.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SHOP_OWNED |= Entrepreneur, eh?

CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_GREETING_ANIMAL_DOG_DISLIKE |= You ain't nothing but a hound dog!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_GREETING_ANIMAL_DOG_DISLIKE |= I can smell damp socks. Or dogs.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_GREETING_ANIMAL_DOG_DISLIKE |= Don't wag that tail at me!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_GREETING_ANIMAL_DOG_DISLIKE |= Horrid animals.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_GREETING_ANIMAL_DOG_DISLIKE |= Keep that monster away from me.

CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_BAKEOFF |= I love a good competition.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_BAKEOFF |= I hope we don't get the same winner this year.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_BAKEOFF |= It's not just down to raw skill; you have to be intelligent enough to know what items to display.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_BAKEOFF |= Maybe I should enter this year?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_BAKEOFF |= I can almost taste the entries already.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_BAKEOFF |= I hope there are some meals left after the judging is over.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_BAKEOFF |= Am not a bad cook myself when I'm not burning things.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_BAKEOFF |= We should do this every year rather than annually.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_BAKEOFF |= It puts me in the mood to buy lots of food.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_BAKEOFF |= Will the winning entry be available to buy?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_BAKEOFF |= Hmmm, those smells!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_BAKEOFF |= If I cared for autographs, I would ask for one.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_BAKEOFF |= It must take great skill to win. Or culinary bribery.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_BAKEOFF |= A cook with good stamina will go far. Literally.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_FISHSHOW |= This is exciting! Fish ahoy!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_FISHSHOW |= If I had a bigger rod, I would enter.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_FISHSHOW |= I wonder who will catch the best fish?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_FISHSHOW |= Fishing is a handy skill to have.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_FISHSHOW |= I love seeing what people catch.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_FISHSHOW |= A highly skilled fisherman will win.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_FISHSHOW |= Do we get to bake the winner in a pie? Fish, I mean.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_FISHSHOW |= I am hooked on this event.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_FISHSHOW |= This event doesn't smell as nice as the bake-off.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_FISHSHOW |= Don't flap trying to win!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_FLOWERSHOW |= What a great smell!

CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_FLOWERSHOW |= I wonder who will win.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_FLOWERSHOW |= I'm a Flower Show stalker.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_FLOWERSHOW |= Dying to sniff the winners!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_FLOWERSHOW |= I have blue fingers, not green.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_FLOWERSHOW |= Beautiful flowers!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_JAMCONTEST |= What a great smell!

CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_VEGSHOW |= I wish I could grow quality veg.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_VEGSHOW |= I need a leek!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_VEGSHOW |= Competition is fierce this year!
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_VEGSHOW |= Who has got the goods?
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_VEGSHOW |= This is the greatest talent show.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_VEGSHOW |= Very impressive entries.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_SPECIAL_TREE_DIALOGUE_VEGSHOW |= Is that podium strong enough to hold them?

CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_TOTEM |= It's starting to feel evil around here; someone should do something about that.
CONTEXTDIALOGUE_GENERAL_TOTEM |= I saw an evil-looking totem the other day with some kind of rift connected to it; that'll be trouble.
