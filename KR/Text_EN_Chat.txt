Chat_Greeting_GARDEN[C][Friendly] |= <Greeting>. I wish people wouldn't pick the fruits before they're ripe. It's such a waste.
Chat_Greeting_GARDEN[C][Like] |= <Greeting>. I'm glad you're here, my arms are aching from all the picking.

Chat_Happening_SLEEP[C] |= Going home to bed, but not sure I will be able to sleep as usual. Too much noise. I wish those moths would shut up.
Chat_Happening_SLEEP[C] |= Bedtime shortly. Don't know why I bother. I never have interesting dreams.

Chat_Happening_SLEEP[Spouse] |= Time for beddy bye-byes! 
Chat_Happening_SLEEP[Spouse] |= I need a good sleep. Goodnight dear.
Chat_Happening_SLEEP[Spouse] |= I am heading to bed for a well-deserved slumber.
Chat_Happening_SLEEP[Spouse] |= It's bedtime. Don't stay up too late; your eyes are redder than our tomatoes.

Chat_Happening_SLEEP[OwnKid] |= Awww, do I have to go to bed?
Chat_Happening_SLEEP[OwnKid] |= Oh is it really bedtime?
Chat_Happening_SLEEP[OwnKid] |= I am going to sleep. Goodnight, Dad, Mum, whatever your preference.
Chat_Happening_SLEEP[OwnKid] |= Night night! Don't let the bed witch bite!

Chat_Happening_SLEEP[OwnKidAdult] |= I am going to do what any son or daughter would do for their parents... sleep.
Chat_Happening_SLEEP[OwnKidAdult] |= It's my bedtime. I need at least 25 hours per day.
Chat_Happening_SLEEP[OwnKidAdult] |= Going to bed. Goodnight, parent of mine.
Chat_Happening_SLEEP[OwnKidAdult] |= It's my bedtime. I have an appointment with Mr. Snooze.

Chat_Happening_GETUP |= 숙면을 취해야 다음 날을 준비할 수 있지.
Chat_Happening_GETUP |= 또 다른 하루가 모험의 손가락으로 손짓하네.
Chat_Happening_GETUP |= 잠은 잘 잤어. 정말 불평할 수 없을만큼.
Chat_Happening_GETUP |= 상쾌한 기분으로 하루를 시작할 준비가 되었어.

Chat_Happening_GETUP[P] |= Another day of wonderful worship and loving nature ahead.
Chat_Happening_GETUP[P] |= The Goddesses visited me in my sleep to thank me for my dedication!
Chat_Happening_GETUP[P] |= I slept the sleep of the devout. Absolutely horribly as we should suffer for our sins.
Chat_Happening_GETUP[P] |= Am glad to be awake. When I am asleep, I cannot revere our wonderful gift of nature.

Chat_Happening_GETUP[J] |= I slept like a log! All brown and long!
Chat_Happening_GETUP[J] |= Oh, I feel magnificent after that kip! I am a great kipper!
Chat_Happening_GETUP[J] |= I dreamt I was a marshmallow, and a pillow ate me! Loved it!
Chat_Happening_GETUP[J] |= Sleep is like a stone egg. You can't beat it!

Chat_Happening_GETUP[B] |= I slept better than you last night. And that's not me being competitive. I'm the most uncompetitive person there is!
Chat_Happening_GETUP[B] |= Another night passed, and another day that the world welcomes my presence.
Chat_Happening_GETUP[B] |= You can't buy a good sleep, they say. Well, I did!
Chat_Happening_GETUP[B] |= I had my beauty sleep. You obviously had an ugly sleep.

Chat_Happening_GETUP[Q] |= 꿈만 같았어! 양들이 울타리를 뛰어넘는 나를 세고 있었어. 그 후에는 상황이 엉망이 되었지.
Chat_Happening_GETUP[Q] |= 소시지 위에서 자는 꿈을 꿨어. 내가 꾼 꿈 중 가장 최악의 잠이었어.
Chat_Happening_GETUP[Q] |= 어젯밤에 악몽을 꿨어. 내가 달걀이었는데 스트레스가 너무 심해서 깨질 뻔했어. 노른자는 없어어!
Chat_Happening_GETUP[Q] |= 내 침대 스프링 중 하나가 나를 싫어하는 것 같아요. 양파 위에서 자야겠어요. 침대 스프링 양파.

Chat_Happening_GETUP[C] |= I slept like the dead. Rotten.
Chat_Happening_GETUP[C] |= My bed is the worst. I may as well just punch myself in the spine all night.
Chat_Happening_GETUP[C] |= Am sure the bedbugs have a vendetta against me. I have more bites than a vampire at a neck festival.
Chat_Happening_GETUP[C] |= Good morning? What's good about it? Just push me in the funeral pool now and be done with it.

Chat_Happening_WORK |= 그냥 일할 뿐이야. 정직한 하루의 노동은 아무도 해치지 않지. 그 일이 괴물과 싸우는 것이 아니라면 말이야.
Chat_Happening_WORK |= 일, 일, 또 일.
Chat_Happening_WORK |= 먹고 살기 위해서. 누군가는 돈을 벌어야지. 그 오리 돈 수집가들은 매번 너를 붙잡지.
Chat_Happening_WORK |= 이것도 조금 저것도 조금 이리 뛰고 저리 뛰고, 돌고 돌고 거래하고. 병에 동전을 더 넣자.

Chat_Happening_WORK[P] |= I am going to work now. I hope the Goddesses can see how much effort I put in.
Chat_Happening_WORK[P] |= Work separates the devout from the lazy. If you love your Goddess, you are energised to work hard.
Chat_Happening_WORK[P] |= Goddesses bless me with the work I am about to do.
Chat_Happening_WORK[P] |= I am looking forward to a good, honest bit of work.

Chat_Happening_WORK[J] |= Work! I love it! When I am not hating it!
Chat_Happening_WORK[J] |= Working. I work about as hard as the butter in my larder. If only I had any butter!
Chat_Happening_WORK[J] |= Got to love a bit of work! Seeing people smile makes the work go easy. I always go to work on a smile. I can't ride pigs that's why.
Chat_Happening_WORK[J] |= Work time! Work is never a chore if you have the right attitude.

Chat_Happening_WORK[B] |= I am the hardest worker in Quill, which is why I am so renowned.
Chat_Happening_WORK[B] |= I am working, but it's a cinch for talented folk like me.
Chat_Happening_WORK[B] |= If they had the best worker award, I would win it, I am sure. There is no I in pie, but there is a ME in meat.
Chat_Happening_WORK[B] |= I am meant to be working, but often, work just does itself for me. I have no idea what that means.

Chat_Happening_WORK[Q] |= I am going to work. It's the only way to earn enough Brass to be able to chew on the coins.
Chat_Happening_WORK[Q] |= My dialogue is meant to suggest I am working, but I often forget who I am. Confused? Me too.
Chat_Happening_WORK[Q] |= I will be pretending to work. This is a role-playing game, after all!
Chat_Happening_WORK[Q] |= Earning Brass. Would be rich if we earned Wood or Soil.

Chat_Happening_WORK[C] |= 일하러 가야지. 내 찡그린 표정에서 알 수 있듯이 정말 행복해.
Chat_Happening_WORK[C] |= 나는 '일'을 해야 해. 내 불쾌감을 강조하기 위해 쉼표를 거꾸로 써서 말했어.
Chat_Happening_WORK[C] |= 내 직업은 꽃에 붙은 벌과 같아. 짜증나지. 그냥 윙윙거리기만 하면 좋겠어.
Chat_Happening_WORK[C] |= 일에 대한 불평 때문에 허리가 아파.

Chat_Happening_FARMING |= Am going to toil in the soil. Need to keep our crop squares tiptop.
Chat_Happening_FARMING[Spouse] |= You set the order for me to tend to the crops, so I feel compelled to do so.
Chat_Happening_FARMING[Spouse] |= I am doing a bit of farming. The soil needs tending to as a lover would tend to their love.
Chat_Happening_FARMING[Spouse] |= Am going to toil in the soil. Need to keep our crop squares tiptop.
Chat_Happening_FARMING[Spouse] |= There's farm work needs doing. Crops and soil, work and toil. Those plots are our dinner plates.

Chat_Happening_GOHOME |= I am going home.
Chat_Happening_GOHOME |= Heading to my lovely home.
Chat_Happening_GOHOME |= I am going back to my house.
Chat_Happening_GOHOME |= Just walking home. Nothing exciting.

Chat_Happening_GOHOME[P] |= I am going home to think of our beautiful Fae deities.
Chat_Happening_GOHOME[P] |= Home time. A time to reflect on our place in the order of things.
Chat_Happening_GOHOME[P] |= I am going back to my humble home to meditate.
Chat_Happening_GOHOME[P] |= Bless the Goddesses for my little home. I am heading there now.

Chat_Happening_GOHOME[J] |= Home is where the heart is. I keep mine in a jar under the bed. Wahey!
Chat_Happening_GOHOME[J] |= I am going back to my house to watch the fire dancing. It's really entertaining!
Chat_Happening_GOHOME[J] |= Just heading home. A spring in my step. Literally, I have some coiled metal in my shoe.
Chat_Happening_GOHOME[J] |= I'm so happy to be heading back to my house. It's where all my fond memories are, and my stuff.

Chat_Happening_GOHOME[B] |= Haven't you got a home to go to like me? Probably not as nice as mine, though.
Chat_Happening_GOHOME[B] |= I am heading home after a nice walk, showing off my superior clothing quality.
Chat_Happening_GOHOME[B] |= I am going home. Some of us have nice homes to go to and don't waste time chatting with folk.
Chat_Happening_GOHOME[B] |= Going home to my silk sheets, fine food and spotless windows.

Chat_Happening_GOHOME[Q] |= I am going back to my house. It's nothing much in the grand scheme of things, but it has a working toilet and see-through windows, so all good.
Chat_Happening_GOHOME[Q] |= Home time! I love to sit in my chair and stare at the spiders in the rafters. I named mine Rita, Sue and Kevin. Sadly, Bob got squashed.
Chat_Happening_GOHOME[Q] |= I am walking home. I love the sight of my three walls. Apparently, there are four, but I can't count that high.
Chat_Happening_GOHOME[Q] |= I am going to that place where everybody knows my name. No, not the pub... home! Cheers!

Chat_Happening_GOHOME[C] |= I am going home, and my feet hurt. Can never get good shoes these days. It's cobblers, I tell you.
Chat_Happening_GOHOME[C] |= I am going back to my house. It is damp and smelly. I would burn it down, but it's just too damp.
Chat_Happening_GOHOME[C] |= It's time for me to go home. Well, I would if my dandelion worked. I sneezed, and now it is apparently 12 hours later.
Chat_Happening_GOHOME[C] |= Going home. I hate going home. I like being at home sometimes; I just don't like the going there part.

Chat_Happening_GARDEN |= Just sorting out the garden.
Chat_Happening_GARDEN |= A nice bit of gardening.
Chat_Happening_GARDEN |= Just tending to my humble garden.
Chat_Happening_GARDEN |= Lovely day for some gardening.

Chat_Happening_GARDEN[P] |= Gardening. It is growth that makes a person better.
Chat_Happening_GARDEN[P] |= Gardening is the best way to appreciate nature's bounty. 
Chat_Happening_GARDEN[P] |= I need to tend to my garden. It is one small way to give back to nature.
Chat_Happening_GARDEN[P] |= I am growing simple things for my simple self. The Goddesses appreciate that, I am sure.

Chat_Happening_GARDEN[J] |= Got to do some gardening. It's great to be outdoors getting some fresh air!
Chat_Happening_GARDEN[J] |= I am gardening. You just can't beat it! Especially if you love gardening.
Chat_Happening_GARDEN[J] |= Gardening makes me smile. I think my gardening pants are too tight.
Chat_Happening_GARDEN[J] |= Get out and do some gardening like me! It's great fun!

Chat_Happening_GARDEN[B] |= I have to keep my excellent garden in order.
Chat_Happening_GARDEN[B] |= Tending my garden. It's the first thing passers-by see, so it must be up to mustard plants.
Chat_Happening_GARDEN[B] |= I have to garden. How else would I impress other gardeners?
Chat_Happening_GARDEN[B] |= I am gardening. I use only the best tools.

Chat_Happening_GARDEN[Q] |= I am sorting out my garden. I like to talk to the worms at length.
Chat_Happening_GARDEN[Q] |= I am culturing my horti. Yes, I have no idea what horti are. I thought they might be seed fairies.
Chat_Happening_GARDEN[Q] |= I am tending to my little garden. Every time I bend down, I get a hole in my plants.
Chat_Happening_GARDEN[Q] |= What does it look like I am doing? Gardening? Oh, that's right.

Chat_Happening_GARDEN[C] |= I am sure my garden is plotting against me.
Chat_Happening_GARDEN[C] |= My back hurts from gardening. Even the thought of gardening causes back pain.
Chat_Happening_GARDEN[C] |= I am gardening. I would get more done if I didn't have to keep answering obvious questions.
Chat_Happening_GARDEN[C] |= This garden needs sorting. It doesn't matter what I do; it always gets dirty.

Chat_Happening_GARDEN[Spouse] |= I am just getting some of those weeds pulled up in our garden.
Chat_Happening_GARDEN[Spouse] |= I am doing a nice bit of gardening to help keep it looking nice for us.
Chat_Happening_GARDEN[Spouse] |= Got to sort the garden out. Apparently, our house Brounie thinks the garden is beneath him. Which it is.
Chat_Happening_GARDEN[Spouse] |= Nice day for some gardening. A marital home is nothing without a neat garden.

Chat_Happening_GARDEN[OwnKid] |= Do I have to do the gardening? It's hard work!
Chat_Happening_GARDEN[OwnKid] |= I keep finding worms. They have smiley faces.
Chat_Happening_GARDEN[OwnKid] |= You told me to help in the garden. It's not fair.
Chat_Happening_GARDEN[OwnKid] |= I am playing in the garden. I mean working hard.

Chat_Happening_GARDEN[OwnKidAdult] |= I am helping you out by doing the gardening. Your appreciation is noted.
Chat_Happening_GARDEN[OwnKidAdult] |= Do I have to do this at my age? Gardening is for really old people.
Chat_Happening_GARDEN[OwnKidAdult] |= Getting my fingers green in the garden.
Chat_Happening_GARDEN[OwnKidAdult] |= Doing my chores. Do I still get pocket money at my age?

Chat_Happening_RELAX |= Just relaxing a bit.
Chat_Happening_RELAX |= Taking it easy. Restful body, restful mind.
Chat_Happening_RELAX |= It is my time to relax a bit and enjoy the world.
Chat_Happening_RELAX |= I am recharging my butteries. I think that's the expression.

Chat_Happening_RELAX[P] |= Even the Goddesses relax, and when they do, I do.
Chat_Happening_RELAX[P] |= I am meditating and thinking of our beloved guardians.
Chat_Happening_RELAX[P] |= I am relaxing. The body needs to be ready for worship at any time.
Chat_Happening_RELAX[P] |= I am taking it easy for all you sinners, dude.

Chat_Happening_RELAX[J] |= I am having some me time. It's the best time after dinner time and read a book on the toilet time.
Chat_Happening_RELAX[J] |= Having a bit of a wind-down! All that laughing knackers a person out!
Chat_Happening_RELAX[J] |= I am not being lazy. I am just expressing my right not to do anything. *winks*
Chat_Happening_RELAX[J] |= Relax! Don't do it! When you want to fart, brew it! 

Chat_Happening_RELAX[B] |= I am having a well-deserved rest. Success demands it.
Chat_Happening_RELAX[B] |= Rest is for the wicked. I am having a rest.
Chat_Happening_RELAX[B] |= Time stands still for no man. Well, except for the quality ones, so I am having a rest.
Chat_Happening_RELAX[B] |= If you live a life wanting the best, then you will have time to rest. Mainly because you can afford to pay others to do your jobs.

Chat_Happening_RELAX[Q] |= Life is like a box of Candy Squirrels. You always know there are nuts in it. That's why you need to relax and take it easy, Mr Squirrel. 
Chat_Happening_RELAX[Q] |= I am just resting my eyes. The rest of me is still very active, though.
Chat_Happening_RELAX[Q] |= Just having some me time. It is the time of day I like to breathe in deeply and hopefully remember to breathe out again. I sometimes forget and float off.
Chat_Happening_RELAX[Q] |= My routine says RELAX, so that is exactly what I intend to do!

Chat_Happening_RELAX[C] |= Even my relaxing time is disturbed by nattering!
Chat_Happening_RELAX[C] |= I can't talk much more; my jaw aches.
Chat_Happening_RELAX[C] |= I am trying to relax, but as usual, it never happens.
Chat_Happening_RELAX[C] |= I may as well just relax in Toughwood. Get more peace there, I bet. Definitely more pieces.

Chat_Happening_RELAX[Spouse] |= Ahhh, some mind and body cleansing relaxation.
Chat_Happening_RELAX[Spouse] |= I am having a break, dear, from the hustle and bustle of daily life on our farm.
Chat_Happening_RELAX[Spouse] |= I am giving my aching muscles some respite. Go easy on that scheduling, dearest.
Chat_Happening_RELAX[Spouse] |= A well-deserved break from the every day, if you don't mind, my sweet honeypot.

Chat_Happening_RELAX[OwnKid] |= Playtime!
Chat_Happening_RELAX[OwnKid] |= I am playing.
Chat_Happening_RELAX[OwnKid] |= It's time to play!
Chat_Happening_RELAX[OwnKid] |= It's my playtime. Zoooom!

Chat_Happening_RELAX[OwnKidAdult] |= It's nice to know you care what I am doing. Or are you just checking up on me?
Chat_Happening_RELAX[OwnKidAdult] |= I am having a little break from the endless grind.
Chat_Happening_RELAX[OwnKidAdult] |= Just unwinding and thinking of how lucky we are to be here.
Chat_Happening_RELAX[OwnKidAdult] |= I need a rest. Being your child is exhausting, even though I am grown up.

Chat_Happening_SOCIALISE |= I am going to talk to my pals.
Chat_Happening_SOCIALISE[OwnKid] |= I want to see my invisible friends.
Chat_Happening_SOCIALISE[OwnKid] |= I am going to talk to my pals.
Chat_Happening_SOCIALISE[OwnKid] |= I am searching for deep, meaningful human interactions that will fulfil my soul and expand my intellect.

Chat_Happening_STUDY |= 쉬이이잇, 나 공부하고 있어.
Chat_Happening_STUDY[OwnKid] |= 쉬이이잇, 나 공부하고 있어.
Chat_Happening_STUDY[OwnKid] |= I am doing my homework as you asked.
Chat_Happening_STUDY[OwnKid] |= I am expanding my mind through the usage of literary works, both fact, fictional and nonsense.
Chat_Happening_STUDY[OwnKid] |= I am trying to raise my intelligence stat through study.

Chat_Happening_MILKCOW |= 누군가는 젖소의 젖을 짜줘야 하니까 내가 할게.

Chat_Happening_MILKCOW[Spouse] |= 우리 사랑스러운 젖소에서 우유를 좀 가져올게.
Chat_Happening_MILKCOW[Spouse] |= 젖을 좀 짜려고.
Chat_Happening_MILKCOW[Spouse] |= 내 이름이 적힌 양동이가 있어. 내가 우유라고 불렸다면.
Chat_Happening_MILKCOW[Spouse] |= 누군가는 젖소의 젖을 짜줘야 하니까 내가 할게.

Chat_Happening_MILKCOW[OwnKidAdult] |= Have I got to milk that cow? Its udders make me shudder.
Chat_Happening_MILKCOW[OwnKidAdult] |= Going to milk the cow. Need milk if I am to stay healthy and strong.
Chat_Happening_MILKCOW[OwnKidAdult] |= The cow is calling my name. Well, I am not called moo, but it is suggesting I milk it.
Chat_Happening_MILKCOW[OwnKidAdult] |= Going to do some milking, just because.

Chat_Happening_GET_HONEY |= I am going to talk to the bees and see what I can trade with them.

Chat_Happening_GET_HONEY[Spouse] |= I am collecting honey, honey.
Chat_Happening_GET_HONEY[Spouse] |= I am going to talk to the bees and see what I can trade with them.
Chat_Happening_GET_HONEY[Spouse] |= I am likely going to get stung. Honey prices these days!
Chat_Happening_GET_HONEY[Spouse] |= There is some nectar that needs harvesting from the hive, so I am going to do it.

Chat_Happening_GET_HONEY[OwnKid] |= Honey time! Yum!
Chat_Happening_GET_HONEY[OwnKid] |= I have to go get some honey for us all. Yay!
Chat_Happening_GET_HONEY[OwnKid] |= Those bees stung me! It's not fair!
Chat_Happening_GET_HONEY[OwnKid] |= Mrs Queen Bee said I could take some honey if I trade her some cakes. Honest.

Chat_Happening_GET_HONEY[OwnKidAdult] |= It's my favourite time. Dodge bees and grab their honey time.
Chat_Happening_GET_HONEY[OwnKidAdult] |= I am collecting honey to meet my needs. Our needs.
Chat_Happening_GET_HONEY[OwnKidAdult] |= Going to get me some sweeeeet honey!
Chat_Happening_GET_HONEY[OwnKidAdult] |= I am going to fill up on the amber nectar. No, not beer, yet.

Chat_Happening_EXPLORE |= Am going exploring! 
Chat_Happening_EXPLORE[OwnKid] |= I am just off out for a wander and to find fun things.
Chat_Happening_EXPLORE[OwnKid] |= Am going exploring!
Chat_Happening_EXPLORE[OwnKid] |= Exploring time!
Chat_Happening_EXPLORE[OwnKid] |= Is it OK if I go exploring? I like finding things hidden away, like those little doors.

Chat_Happening_PETS |= I am just sorting out the animals.

Chat_Happening_PETS[Spouse] |= I am just sorting out the animals. Someone has to!
Chat_Happening_PETS[Spouse] |= I am just tending to the pets. Got to love them!
Chat_Happening_PETS[Spouse] |= I need to tend to the animals. They can't feed themselves! Well, they sort of can and do.
Chat_Happening_PETS[Spouse] |= Just going to groom and pamper the pets. Lucky things.

Chat_Happening_PETS[OwnKid] |= I want to stroke the pets! Unless I have the animal hater trait, in which case I don't.
Chat_Happening_PETS[OwnKid] |= I am going to feed the animals. 
Chat_Happening_PETS[OwnKid] |= Going to feed our pets, as you said.
Chat_Happening_PETS[OwnKid] |= Pet time!

Chat_Happening_PETS[OwnKidAdult] |= I am going to sort the pets out.
Chat_Happening_PETS[OwnKidAdult] |= Time to feed the pets as commanded. Would rather be doing something less smelly.
Chat_Happening_PETS[OwnKidAdult] |= It's feeding time at the zoo. I learned that a zoo was a kind of crazy animal house, a bit like our home.
Chat_Happening_PETS[OwnKidAdult] |= I am just going to see if the pets are ok, as you asked. 

Chat_Happening_EAT |= 뭐 좀 먹으러 갈게.
Chat_Happening_EAT |= 배가 좀 고파서 평소대로 먹으려고.
Chat_Happening_EAT |= 벌레를 조금 먹으려고. 아니면 다른 작은 곤충도.
Chat_Happening_EAT |= 군것질에 대한 갈망을 충족시켜줄 간식이 필요해.

Chat_Happening_EAT[P] |= I am about to eat after I say a little prayer of thanks.
Chat_Happening_EAT[P] |= Food sustains the body. Worship sustains the soul.
Chat_Happening_EAT[P] |= I am eating something, so I have energy for reverence.
Chat_Happening_EAT[P] |= All things must eat. It is the will of the Goddesses that we develop, eat, fertilise and grow.

Chat_Happening_EAT[J] |= I am peckish... said the small chicken to the Druid.
Chat_Happening_EAT[J] |= I could murder a nice meal, but murder isn't even a concept in this day and age, so I will just eat one.
Chat_Happening_EAT[J] |= I need to eat. Gotta love food! It's even better when it's free!
Chat_Happening_EAT[J] |= I was about to fill my empty belly with the fruits of, well, fruit trees.

Chat_Happening_EAT[B] |= I need to eat. A person of quality needs to maintain energy.
Chat_Happening_EAT[B] |= My food is always top-tier, so I shall endeavour to eat some and absorb its quality.
Chat_Happening_EAT[B] |= I need to eat. I could probably eat more than any Ogyr easily.
Chat_Happening_EAT[B] |= I am going to eat something rich because you are what you eat.

Chat_Happening_EAT[Q] |= I am going to run the gauntlet of eating cooked food.
Chat_Happening_EAT[Q] |= My first is in Pie but not in Cake. I rhyme with meat but not with pudding. What am I? Other than starving?
Chat_Happening_EAT[Q] |= It's time for Mr Pastry to go potholing in Rumblytum Cavern.
Chat_Happening_EAT[Q] |= I could eat a horse. Perhaps that's why they became extinct? In that logic, why aren't pies extinct?

Chat_Happening_EAT[C] |= It's time for me to eat. I bet it tastes like squirrel droppings again. I really must stop snacking on those.
Chat_Happening_EAT[C] |= Uuugghh, food time. I bet it's cold salad again.
Chat_Happening_EAT[C] |= I need to eat, but my stomach faery is really fussy.
Chat_Happening_EAT[C] |= A bowmaker once tried to test me. I ate his quiver with some Crystal Beans and a nice Pea Shandy.

Chat_Happening_EAT[Spouse] |= I am eating if you do not mind? It's rude to talk with your face stuffed.
Chat_Happening_EAT[Spouse] |= I am just grabbing some grub as I am famished.
Chat_Happening_EAT[Spouse] |= I am just eating this delicious meal provided for us by your good self and the Goddesses.
Chat_Happening_EAT[Spouse] |= Just getting some well-earned nourishment, O love of my life.

Chat_Happening_EAT[OwnKid] |= I am eating my food.
Chat_Happening_EAT[OwnKid] |= I am hungry. Food time!
Chat_Happening_EAT[OwnKid] |= Mmfffmmm I am grmmpphh eatin'.
Chat_Happening_EAT[OwnKid] |= Yay! Foody time!

Chat_Happening_EAT[OwnKidAdult] |= Do you have to talk to me while I am eating?
Chat_Happening_EAT[OwnKidAdult] |= I am hungry, so just filling my belly up.
Chat_Happening_EAT[OwnKidAdult] |= It's my favourite time of day... gorging time.
Chat_Happening_EAT[OwnKidAdult] |= Just having some nourishment. Being your child is draining.

Chat_Happening_TAVERN |= Am going to have a nice drink.
Chat_Happening_TAVERN |= I don't endorse drunken behaviour, but I do endorse drinking.
Chat_Happening_TAVERN |= I'm just here for the beer.
Chat_Happening_TAVERN |= I am going to talk to the spirits and see which one wants me to drink them.

Chat_Happening_TAVERN[P] |= I am going to the tavern to quench my thirst after a hard day's worship.
Chat_Happening_TAVERN[P] |= I don't believe in getting drunk unless instructed to by our Fae deities.
Chat_Happening_TAVERN[P] |= I find that the tavern is a wonderful place to spread the word of the Goddesses. And have a little tipple on the side. It's thirsty work!
Chat_Happening_TAVERN[P] |= I could worship a ******* pint right now.

Chat_Happening_TAVERN[J] |= Drink, drink, and be merry! Taverns are the place to be!
Chat_Happening_TAVERN[J] |= Am looking forward to a lovely beer and some terrible bar snacks.
Chat_Happening_TAVERN[J] |= You can't beat a tavern for the sound of laughter, merriment and projectile vomiting.
Chat_Happening_TAVERN[J] |= I am going to have so much booze I will forget what I was going to the tavern for, then have another drink to remind myself.

Chat_Happening_TAVERN[B] |= Tavern time is a great time to show everyone the proper way to drink.
Chat_Happening_TAVERN[B] |= I bet I could drink anyone under the table. Not literally.
Chat_Happening_TAVERN[B] |= I once drank 13 pints of Dragonsbreath and it did nothing to me. My ancestors, however, all got poisoned livers.
Chat_Happening_TAVERN[B] |= I am the best drinker in all Quill, and I am going to prove it someday. Just a small tipple now, though.

Chat_Happening_TAVERN[Q] |= Drinkapintabeeraday. Hank Hock told me that half an hour ago.
Chat_Happening_TAVERN[Q] |= I hope the tavern has some good entertainment on. I like Jester Draws. He's outstanding. Over there in that field.
Chat_Happening_TAVERN[Q] |= Am going to replace my blood with some good old-fashioned alcohol. If I die, I will come back as a very unstable bee.
Chat_Happening_TAVERN[Q] |= I need a drink like a worm needs shoes! Oh, hang on...

Chat_Happening_TAVERN[C] |= 이 지긋지긋한 삶을 잊기 위해 술 한 잔 해야겠어.
Chat_Happening_TAVERN[C] |= 주점에 가는 중이야. 거기서 냄새가 나긴 하지만 신음하는 놈들은 선택의 여지가 없지.
Chat_Happening_TAVERN[C] |= 저 끔찍한 음유시인이 무대에 오르지 않았으면 좋겠어. 소가 뜨개질하듯 류트를 연주하지.
Chat_Happening_TAVERN[C] |= 내가 마실 맥주는 틀림없이 누군가 치즈 발로 으깬 것 같은 맛이 날 거야. 인생에서 적어도 한 가지는 좋은 게 있지.

Chat_Happening_WALK |= 멋진 산책을 하러 가는 중이야!
Chat_Happening_WALK |= 전통적인 방식으로 운동을 좀 하려고. 무작정 걷기.
Chat_Happening_WALK |= 하얀 길을 조금 두드리는 것뿐이야. 내가 걷고있다는 뜻이지.
Chat_Happening_WALK |= 이봐! 내가 여기를 걸어가고 있잖아! 자정이 아니라서 다행이네, 카우보이.

Chat_Happening_WALK[P] |= 예배를 드리기 위해서는 훌륭하고 정직한 산책이 필요해.
Chat_Happening_WALK[P] |= 그냥 돌아다니면서 멋진 자연을 감상해봐.
Chat_Happening_WALK[P] |= 우리의 경이로운 여신들의 시선 아래에서 사랑스러운 산책을 하게 될 거야.
Chat_Happening_WALK[P] |= 나는 단지 오로레의 부드러운 담요 아래를 걷는 게 좋아.

Chat_Happening_WALK[J] |= 나는 유쾌하고 늙었기 때문에 그냥 유쾌하게 산책하러 가고 있어.
Chat_Happening_WALK[J] |= 순회라는 단어가 재밌어서 킥킥 웃음이 나.
Chat_Happening_WALK[J] |= 멋진 퀼리언의 공기를 폐에 가득 채우기 위해 산책하러 가는 거야! 
Chat_Happening_WALK[J] |= 나는 산책을 정말 좋아해! 여행하면서 모든 곳을 돌아녀봤다고 확신해.

Chat_Happening_WALK[B] |= 난 퀼에서 최고의 워커야, 알지?
Chat_Happening_WALK[B] |= 남들의 열등한 집을 구경하기 위해 이 땅을 거닐고 있지.
Chat_Happening_WALK[B] |= 나는 단지 산책을 하고 있을 뿐이야. 산책이 나의 놀라운 아이디어를 떠올리는 방법이기 때문이지.
Chat_Happening_WALK[B] |= 이 부츠는 산책용으로 만들어졌어. 솔직히 말해서, 최고급 구부린 낸시로 만들어졌어.

Chat_Happening_WALK[Q] |= 나 산책할 예정이야. 나 달산책 할 수 있어, 알지? 그냥 밤에 나가는 거지.
Chat_Happening_WALK[Q] |= 나는 성큼성큼 걸어 나가는 것을 좋아해. 셔플을 신는 것보다 낫지.
Chat_Happening_WALK[Q] |= 방황해본 적 있어? 이에 대해 몇 시간 동안 얘기할 수 있었어.
Chat_Happening_WALK[Q] |= 다리를 쭉 뻗을 거야,라고 고문대에 있던 마조히스트가 말했다.

Chat_Happening_WALK[C] |= 아, 내가 지금 하고 있는 이 산책을 생각만 해도 발이 아파.
Chat_Happening_WALK[C] |= 나는 산책이 얼마나 지루한지 잊기 위해 산책을 하려고.
Chat_Happening_WALK[C] |= 신선한 공기를 마시러 나가는 거야. 신선하다는 것은 맥주와 소똥 냄새를 의미하지.
Chat_Happening_WALK[C] |= 정말 산책하러 가야 하나? 피곤해. 내 루틴을 편집기에서 변경해야 해.

Chat_Happening_SHOPPING |= 소모품을 사러 상점에 가는 중이야.
Chat_Happening_SHOPPING |= 소모품! 소모품! 예상치 못한 가격에 눈이 휘둥그레졌어. 
Chat_Happening_SHOPPING |= 불필요한 물건을 사려고.
Chat_Happening_SHOPPING |= 나 자신을 치료하러 가지. 버터, 밀가루, 계란, 강 송어. 어묵을 만들고 있어.

Chat_Happening_SHOPPING[P] |= I am going to the store to find gifts for our beloved Goddesses.
Chat_Happening_SHOPPING[P] |= I need to stock up on the basics.
Chat_Happening_SHOPPING[P] |= I am a bit short on offerings, so going to buy more.
Chat_Happening_SHOPPING[P] |= A Goddess whispered to me that I need retail therapy. I didn't have a tail to begin with so I will just go shopping instead.

Chat_Happening_SHOPPING[J] |= I am going to buy some lovely treats. I mean essentials!
Chat_Happening_SHOPPING[J] |= Can't beat a bit of window shopping, especially if you need new windows!
Chat_Happening_SHOPPING[J] |= I am going to get a few things from this shopping list. And a few things that aren't on it, I am sure!
Chat_Happening_SHOPPING[J] |= I love shopping and seeing what's in store.

Chat_Happening_SHOPPING[B] |= 나는 나에게 익숙한 명품에 더 많은 돈을 쓸거야.
Chat_Happening_SHOPPING[B] |= 아주 특별한 사람을 위한 선물을 사야 해. 바로 나!
Chat_Happening_SHOPPING[B] |= 물질적 이득과 과시를 통해 내 모든 돈과 성공을 정당화해야 하기 때문에 쇼핑을 하고 있지.
Chat_Happening_SHOPPING[B] |= 나는 상점에 갈 예정이야. 상점을 살 수도 있고.

Chat_Happening_SHOPPING[Q] |= 그냥 가게에 들른 거야. 돼지에게 가스 찬 사과를 주려는 게 아니라.
Chat_Happening_SHOPPING[Q] |= 내년에 잊어버린 생일 선물을 사야 하거든. 어떻게 해야 할지 모르겠네.
Chat_Happening_SHOPPING[Q] |= 내 팔 길이만큼이나 긴 쇼핑 목록이 있어. 나는 손글씨가 크고 팔이 짧아서 목록에 두 가지 품목이 있지.
Chat_Happening_SHOPPING[Q] |= 할인이 진행 중인가? 나는 좋은 할인을 좋아해. 나쁜 할인도 좋아하지. 난 그냥 할인이 좋아!

Chat_Happening_SHOPPING[C] |= 쇼핑 중인데 원하는 상품이 재고가 없을 것 같아.
Chat_Happening_SHOPPING[C] |= 잡동사니를 좀 사야 하는데 줄서는 걸 싫어해. 스트레스로 생긴 주름보다 줄이 더 길어.
Chat_Happening_SHOPPING[C] |= 요즘 물가를 보셨나? 인플레이션 농담은 다른 데서 쓰는 거라 못 쓰겠어!
Chat_Happening_SHOPPING[C] |= 쇼핑을 정말 좋아하지 않지만 쇼핑은 해야 해. 하지만 나는 브라스로 만들어지지 않았기 때문에 선물을 사지 않을 거야. 나는 고기로 만들어졌으니까.

Chat_Happening_WORSHIP |= Just about to make some offerings.
Chat_Happening_WORSHIP |= I am all ready to worship.
Chat_Happening_WORSHIP |= Going to get me some blessings!
Chat_Happening_WORSHIP |= Revering our fair Goddesses, mainly because if I don't, I might end up as a newt.

Chat_Happening_WORSHIP[P] |= My favourite time of day. Worship time!
Chat_Happening_WORSHIP[P] |= I worship this part of the day. Literally. It's worship time.
Chat_Happening_WORSHIP[P] |= Everyone should do as I do and pay reverence to those who guide us. No, not Thatterways! Goddesses!
Chat_Happening_WORSHIP[P] |= I am just heading to the local Goddess Statue to pay homage with some fromage. That's ancient tongue that means an item 'from an age'. I think.

Chat_Happening_WORSHIP[J] |= Worship time! I just love showering the celestial Ladies with gifts!
Chat_Happening_WORSHIP[J] |= Oh, I am about to worship. It's nice to say a little thanks and get some handy blessings.
Chat_Happening_WORSHIP[J] |= It's worship time. I personally like to do a little dance to impress those who watch us.
Chat_Happening_WORSHIP[J] |= Dance with me! It's time to celebrate our beloved Goddesses!

Chat_Happening_WORSHIP[B] |= I am just going to give my high-quality gifts to the Goddesses.
Chat_Happening_WORSHIP[B] |= I always seem to get great favour with the Goddesses. They must love me.
Chat_Happening_WORSHIP[B] |= What are you offering the Goddesses? 5-star items like me?
Chat_Happening_WORSHIP[B] |= Sometimes I think people should worship me!

Chat_Happening_WORSHIP[Q] |= It's time to worship. I like to offer in alphabetical order, starting with number 1.
Chat_Happening_WORSHIP[Q] |= What are you going to offer? I am going to offer something but can't decide between what's in my left pocket or what is now squashed in my right pocket.
Chat_Happening_WORSHIP[Q] |= I am in full worship mode. I have no choice. I was designed that way.
Chat_Happening_WORSHIP[Q] |= Do you hear the Goddesses whisper when making offerings? Am sure I heard someone say, "Put the ******* potion in the ******* offering bowl!". Then complete silence, except for some lambs bleating.

Chat_Happening_WORSHIP[C] |= Do I have to kneel to worship? My joints creak like old trees.
Chat_Happening_WORSHIP[C] |= Just about to make my offerings. I am sure I will be cursed to be a miserable old Puck again.
Chat_Happening_WORSHIP[C] |= Off to worship. I seem to get nothing much back! No idea why I do it.
Chat_Happening_WORSHIP[C] |= Oh, the joyous time of day we pay homage to those who couldn't care less about my dodgy knees.

Chat_Happening_OFFERING |= I am making offerings so that our home can remain safe and blessed.

Chat_Happening_OFFERING[Spouse] |= I am making offerings so that our home can remain safe and blessed.
Chat_Happening_OFFERING[Spouse] |= Worship time. I want to meditate and embrace the spirit of our beloved Goddesses.
Chat_Happening_OFFERING[Spouse] |= I am worshipping now. Please do not disturb my transcendental harmonising.
Chat_Happening_OFFERING[Spouse] |= I am just filling up this bowl with goodies so the house Brounie stops putting ants in my slippers.

Chat_Happening_OFFERING[OwnKid] |= I am going to put things in Mr Pott's big bowl.
Chat_Happening_OFFERING[OwnKid] |= You said I should make an offering to Mr Pott.
Chat_Happening_OFFERING[OwnKid] |= I am putting things in that bowl for lovely Mr Pott.
Chat_Happening_OFFERING[OwnKid] |= Offering time! Hurray!

Chat_Happening_OFFERING[OwnKidAdult] |= I am going to pay my respects to our Guardians.
Chat_Happening_OFFERING[OwnKidAdult] |= I am going to make the offerings that keep us alive and in human form.
Chat_Happening_OFFERING[OwnKidAdult] |= Just going to put some food in the big bowl.
Chat_Happening_OFFERING[OwnKidAdult] |= I am going to go meditate by the bowl and pay our dues to the Fae folk.

Chat_Happening_COOK |= I am just cooking up a nice little meal.
Chat_Happening_COOK |= I was making a lovely pie. Three point one four two to be precise.
Chat_Happening_COOK |= I am going to whip up a lovely snack using only the finest whatevers.
Chat_Happening_COOK |= Am cooking something just like mother used to make. Iron-hard cake and cremated sausages.

Chat_Happening_COOK[P] |= I am cooking up something special for our beautiful and doubtless hungry Goddesses.
Chat_Happening_COOK[P] |= They say piety begins in the heart, but the energy to be pious begins in the stomach.
Chat_Happening_COOK[P] |= I am baking some simple products for my next offerings.
Chat_Happening_COOK[P] |= I am going to cook up some wholesome food.

Chat_Happening_COOK[J] |= Just making something yummy for my tummy!
Chat_Happening_COOK[J] |= I just love cooking! My favourite bit is scraping out the cake mix with my finger.
Chat_Happening_COOK[J] |= Cooking up a delicious meal!
Chat_Happening_COOK[J] |= I am making some delicious grub to satisfy the hunger fairies.

Chat_Happening_COOK[B] |= This meal I am making will be special, even by my standards.
Chat_Happening_COOK[B] |= I am baking the best food anyone has ever tasted.
Chat_Happening_COOK[B] |= I want to boast about my toast. 
Chat_Happening_COOK[B] |= I am preparing a fine meal for my fine stomach. Something so fine I don't even need to chew it.

Chat_Happening_COOK[Q] |= Well, I am trying to rustle up something to eat. When I can unwrap this paper, I will eat what's inside.
Chat_Happening_COOK[Q] |= I am attempting something I have never done before. Edible cooking.
Chat_Happening_COOK[Q] |= Step back; I need to light the stove. Last time I set my eyebrows on fire. 
Chat_Happening_COOK[Q] |= I have to label my mashed-up potatoes. I need a hashtag! Just kidding, potatoes don't exist.

Chat_Happening_COOK[C] |= I'm absolutely stewing. And this time, I do mean in the cookery sense.
Chat_Happening_COOK[C] |= Am attempting to provide nourishment, but there are vitamins in my cooking that aren't on any apothecary chart.
Chat_Happening_COOK[C] |= My cooking is so bad that even the cockroaches send it back. It could break the teeth of a Barghest.
Chat_Happening_COOK[C] |= Why is cooking so tedious? And all that effort so that I can spend an hour on the plopper.

Chat_Happening_COOK[Spouse] |= I do enjoy a bit of cooking. I love the smells. Makes this home feel even more homely.
Chat_Happening_COOK[Spouse] |= I am just preparing dishes for rumbly tummies.
Chat_Happening_COOK[Spouse] |= I am making some tasty treats.
Chat_Happening_COOK[Spouse] |= I am trying not to burn the food or my fingers.

Chat_Happening_COOK[OwnKid] |= Should I be doing this? Seems dangerous!
Chat_Happening_COOK[OwnKid] |= I like playing with knives and chopping stuff up.
Chat_Happening_COOK[OwnKid] |= I want to do cooking!
Chat_Happening_COOK[OwnKid] |= I am cooking! I promise not to burn anything again.

Chat_Happening_COOK[OwnKidAdult] |= I am just making some delicacies. It's one life skill I am glad I have.
Chat_Happening_COOK[OwnKidAdult] |= Can't you smell what I am doing? I bet they can smell this in Pineshade!
Chat_Happening_COOK[OwnKidAdult] |= I am making something to eat, as instructed. Fancy taking over?
Chat_Happening_COOK[OwnKidAdult] |= You can't beat some lovely cooking to take your mind off everyday problems.

Chat_Happening_OUTHOUSE |= Just going to have a quick tinkle.
Chat_Happening_OUTHOUSE |= I have an urgent call of nature, which is very apt for pagans.
Chat_Happening_OUTHOUSE |= I am just going to relive myself. I mean relieve! That's reincarnation for you!
Chat_Happening_OUTHOUSE |= Too much information, but I need a poo.

Chat_Happening_OUTHOUSE[P] |= You must excuse me as I rid myself of badness.
Chat_Happening_OUTHOUSE[P] |= The Goddesses dictate that I make an offering of the bottom variety.
Chat_Happening_OUTHOUSE[P] |= I am going to reflect on nature, the sky and our Goddesses as I empty my bowels.
Chat_Happening_OUTHOUSE[P] |= Worship on hold as I need to use the outhouse.

Chat_Happening_OUTHOUSE[J] |= I am just going to help Mr Log be reunited with his family.
Chat_Happening_OUTHOUSE[J] |= I love sitting on the loo. An outhouse is a great place to think of genius ideas and great games.
Chat_Happening_OUTHOUSE[J] |= I am bursting for a number 5! That's two number 2's and a 1.
Chat_Happening_OUTHOUSE[J] |= I often laugh so hard I need to piss. So it's off to the outhouse for me!

Chat_Happening_OUTHOUSE[B] |= My toilet has a brown velvet seat, although I do regret that extravagance as it used to be purple.
Chat_Happening_OUTHOUSE[B] |= I plan to build a toilet bigger than most people's houses.
Chat_Happening_OUTHOUSE[B] |= You can't skimp on toilet luxury, you know? I use only the very best leaves.
Chat_Happening_OUTHOUSE[B] |= I have probably eaten too much amazing food and now need to give my quality bowels some respite.

Chat_Happening_OUTHOUSE[Q] |= I am busting for a whizz. In fact, I am whizzing for a whizz.
Chat_Happening_OUTHOUSE[Q] |= Just going to the loo to practice my scales.
Chat_Happening_OUTHOUSE[Q] |= If you hear a loud noise shortly, it was definitely an Ogyr snorting.
Chat_Happening_OUTHOUSE[Q] |= I once saw a Brounie in the outhouse. Not that kind! The faery folk!

Chat_Happening_OUTHOUSE[C] |= Stomach is upset again. I suppose I will be in the outhouse for hours.
Chat_Happening_OUTHOUSE[C] |= I hope the toilet seat isn't cold.
Chat_Happening_OUTHOUSE[C] |= I hate going to the outhouse, especially if it has nettle loo paper.
Chat_Happening_OUTHOUSE[C] |= I am just going to go take a shit if that's alright with you?

Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER |= Busy! Busy! I can't talk right now!
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER |= Hammering this. Nailing that.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER |= Just beavering away on this project. 
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER |= The smell of sawdust and the sound of hard work.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER |= A good deal of building things.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER |= Making good progress on this task you set.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER |= Just busy with this interesting project.

Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[P] |= Just having a stretch and a sip of water. It's hard work, and it's thirsty work.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[P] |= I need to get some nails; otherwise, it's nose to the grindstone.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[P] |= The magnificence of creation is what is happening!
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[P] |= I can tell you what's going on in rhyme: Wood and stone, skin and bone, makes a structure, makes a home. Isn't that nice?
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[P] |= I am humming thankful tunes in honour of the Goddesses as I work.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[P] |= Another construction is being made in honour of our Goddesses.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[P] |= Doing Blessed work.

Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[Q] |= I just had a slight snooze to reinvigorate myself for this hard work.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[Q] |= Working 9 to 6. What a way to make a living.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[Q] |= Just making sure this structure is conforming to Elf & Safety requirements.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[Q] |= Hibblepips keep stealing the nails! They must be short of iron!
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[Q] |= I am re-adjusting the wedging on this doobie-dah. I have no idea, either.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[Q] |= I am looking for my saw. I can't recall where I last erm, what's the word? 
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[Q] |= I was just discussing with myself if it was sandwich time or not. I decided it was.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[Q] |= I am just going to sharpen my hammer.

Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[J] |= I'm making good progress with this build.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[J] |= Well, I was considering a sneaky break until you showed up asking questions *wink*.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[J] |= Just varnished something, and now I'm going to varnish the varnish.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[J] |= Building for my good pal. 
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[J] |= I have a bit more to do yet, but going well!
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[J] |= I am enjoying knocking up this structure!
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[J] |= The joys of creation!

Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[C] |= 도와달라고 부탁받은 작업을 진행 중이야...
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[C] |= 도와주려고 허리에 무리를 하고 있어. 내가 널 좋아해서 다행이다!
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[C] |= 엄지 손가락에서 파편을 빼고 있어.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[C] |= 작업 곡을 흥얼거리고 있었어. 누군가 나한테 닥치라고 소리쳤어.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[C] |= 무슨 일?! 무슨 일이냐고?! 무슨 일인지 말해줄게! 어, 깜빡했네.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[C] |= 예술적 차이. 난 빨간색으로 칠하고 싶은데 다른 사람들은 평평하게 칠하고 싶어해.

Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[B] |= Great work is happening, that's what.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[B] |= It's going up pretty well. You will be pleased with the final results.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[B] |= I am working hard so I can play hard later. That's how us mossy stones roll.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[B] |= Not much is happening if you keep distracting the talent.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[B] |= Not much longer, and you can cut the ribbon on this beauty.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[B] |= I am doing brilliant building.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[B] |= I am just showing off my amazing construction skills.

Chat_Happening_Totem |= I was in <VAR1>and saw Hobs in the bushes! They are roaming beyond the dark forests!
Chat_Happening_Totem |= There's one of them Totem things in <VAR1>. I think you can handle those!
Chat_Happening_Totem |= Hobs are afoot in <VAR1>. Little buggers are draining places of all resources!
Chat_Happening_Totem |= I saw a Hag in <VAR1>. Made me shiver! I could hear her casting a spell as I ran away.
Chat_Happening_Totem |= I heard there was a strange structure in <VAR1>. You should be careful if you go gathering in that place. Apparently, nothing was growing, and the atmosphere was bad. 
Chat_Happening_Totem |= There's a dark Totem in <VAR1>! The Hobs are taking everything! I hope they don't come here!
Chat_Happening_Totem |= You might want to get rid of that evil thing in <VAR1>. It's causing trouble and upsetting the pigeons.
Chat_Happening_Totem |= Have you heard about the Hobs over in <VAR1>? These are worrying times.
Chat_Happening_Totem |= Bad stuff brewing these days. There's a sense of dread in all corners of the world. I heard that something is going down in <VAR1>. If I had a pipe, I would tap it and shake my head disapprovingly.
Chat_Happening_Totem |= You are a good monster fighter, aren't you? Either way, get yourself to <VAR1>and sort those damned Hobs out! 
Chat_Happening_Totem |= Hobs are on the loose, coming through portals and stealing our veg! They even pooped in my water bucket. Now I hear they are looting <VAR1>. Someone needs to damn their eyes, strip the britches from their backsides and warm their heels to Pineshade Bridge! Hurrah!
Chat_Happening_Totem |= Trouble up <VAR1>way. Thieving Hobs and dreadful curses. Bad juju...
Chat_Happening_Totem |= Things are stirring in the land. Stirring up bad! You can feel it in the air. A trader told me there are monsters running around <VAR1>causing all sorts of bother.


Chat_Event_PIG_RACING |= 곧 돼지 경주가 열린다고. 돼지들에게 재미와 건강을 주는 좋은 행사지.
Chat_Event_PIG_RACING |= 돼지 경주가 열리면 페스티벌 그린에 가려고. 
Chat_Event_PIG_RACING |= 돼지 경주가 언제 시작될지 기대돼.

Chat_Event_PIG_RACING[P] |= 페스티벌 그린에서 돼지 경주를 할 시간이 다가오고있어. 나는 그런 경박한 관습을 별로 좋아하지 않아.
Chat_Event_PIG_RACING[P] |= 여신들도 돼지 경주를 볼까?
Chat_Event_PIG_RACING[P] |= 돼지 경주가 열릴 날이 다가오고 있어. 드루이다가 이 멋진 스포츠를 축복해줬으면 좋겠어!

Chat_Event_PIG_RACING[J] |= 곧 돼지 경주가 시작될꺼야! 돼지들이 달릴 때 엉덩이를 흔들며 달리는 모습을 보는 게 너무 좋아!
Chat_Event_PIG_RACING[J] |= 곧 돼지 경주 시간이야! 간식을 따기 위해 도전해야지!
Chat_Event_PIG_RACING[J] |= 돼지들이 서로 경주하는 모습을 보는 것보다 더 재미있는 건 없지. 나도 항상 따라가려고 노력해!

Chat_Event_PIG_RACING[B] |= 곧 페스티벌 그린에서 돼지 경주가 열린다는 거 알고 있었어? 나도 가끔 가서 돼지들이 달리는 모습을 보곤 해.
Chat_Event_PIG_RACING[B] |= 내가 돼지를 키우면 어떤 경주에 내보내도 틀림없이 이길 거야. 경쟁에서 큰 이득을 보지는 못하지만.
Chat_Event_PIG_RACING[B] |= 돼지 경주에서 멋진 애플 파이를 받은 적이 있어. 대회가 열리면 꼭 먹어봐.

Chat_Event_PIG_RACING[Q] |= 돼지 경주를 해본 적이 있어? 난 항상 졌어. 나는 다른 사람들만큼 빨리 달릴 수가 없더라.
Chat_Event_PIG_RACING[Q] |= 곧 돼지 경주를 할 거예요. 나는 내가 승자를 뽑은 척하는 걸 좋아해.
Chat_Event_PIG_RACING[Q] |= 다음에 돼지 경주에 갈겅야? 분홍색 옷을 입고 참가하면 꽤 빨라 보이니까.

Chat_Event_PIG_RACING[C] |= 아, 방금 돼지 경주에 대해 생각하고 있었어. 돼지가 한 마리있어도 상을 못 받거든.
Chat_Event_PIG_RACING[C] |= 아침에 돼지 경주 냄새가 너무 싫어.
Chat_Event_PIG_RACING[C] |= 충고 한마디. 다가오는 페스티벌 그린의 돼지 경주 이벤트에 가지 마. 소리를 지르는 것뿐만 아니라 종종 무언가를 밟을 수도 있어. 그러니 갈거라면 샌들은 신지마.

Chat_Event_PIG_AUCTION |= 돼지 경매 시간이 다가왔어. 경매가 시작되면 현지 시장으로 가서 앉을 빈 상자를 꼭 챙겨!
Chat_Event_PIG_AUCTION |= 이번 주 경매에서 돼지를 살까 생각 중이야. 낙찰이 안 되더라도 적어도 아는 척하는 재미는 있겠지.
Chat_Event_PIG_AUCTION |= 다가오는 돼지 경매에 참석할거야? 언제 열리는지 달력에서 확인해.

Chat_Event_PIG_AUCTION[P] |= It will soon be time for the Pig Auction. The pig is one of nature's many beautiful creatures.
Chat_Event_PIG_AUCTION[P] |= I am thinking about going to the Pig Auction when it is on in Festival Green. We should celebrate all events that we are blessed to have.
Chat_Event_PIG_AUCTION[P] |= Are you going to buy a pig at the upcoming auction? We stopped using animals as offerings many years ago as they just aren't as acceptable as the right kind of offering.

Chat_Event_PIG_AUCTION[J] |= 곧 돼지 경매가 시작될거야! 너무 기대되! 나는 구매를 한 적은 없지만, 입찰의 짜릿함이 너무 좋아!
Chat_Event_PIG_AUCTION[J] |= 돼지 경매에 갈거야? 페스티벌 그린에서 열려. 냄새가 정말 좋네!
Chat_Event_PIG_AUCTION[J] |= 다가오는 돼지 경매에서 돼지 가발을 살까 생각 중이야. 하지만 타는 법을 배워야 할 것 같아.

Chat_Event_PIG_AUCTION[B] |= I once bought all the pigs in the Pig Auction. I sometimes go to the weekly one to watch how cheap everyone else is.
Chat_Event_PIG_AUCTION[B] |= I am considering going to the Pig Auction. I like to imagine buying them all just to prove how wealthy I am, but where to store them is the trouble.
Chat_Event_PIG_AUCTION[B] |= It's nearly time for the Pig Auctions. I should just go and bid 1000 Brass just to see their shocked faces. 

Chat_Event_PIG_AUCTION[Q] |= It's the Pig Auction soon. I once dressed as a pig, and someone bought me for 3 Brass. They got a surprise when they tried sitting on me!
Chat_Event_PIG_AUCTION[Q] |= Am thinking of going to the Pig Auctions on Festival Green when they are on. I was going to take a tall stool so I could be the highest bidder.
Chat_Event_PIG_AUCTION[Q] |= Be careful if you go to the Pig Auction. I once bid 20 Brass on what turned out to be a balloon with a face drawn on it.

Chat_Event_PIG_AUCTION[C] |= Ugh. It's the Pig Auction soon. Seeing your face reminded me. No disrespect to the pigs.
Chat_Event_PIG_AUCTION[C] |= It's nearly that wonderful time of the week when the Pig Auction happens. I just wish that auctioneer wouldn't bang his gavel so hard.
Chat_Event_PIG_AUCTION[C] |= I never win on bids at the Pig Auction. If you go, please show mercy on me if I am there.

Chat_Event_GOODS_MARKET |= It is the Goods Market soon. It has limited variety but good prices if you need to stock up.
Chat_Event_GOODS_MARKET |= It is the Goods market soon. You can sell anything anytime if you hire that Lemonade Stand.
Chat_Event_GOODS_MARKET |= Are you low on seeds and such? Keep your eyes peeled for the Goods Market. 

Chat_Event_GOODS_MARKET[P] |= Market Day soon. A chance to buy offerings and gaze in wonder at our Woodfellow.
Chat_Event_GOODS_MARKET[P] |= Don't forget to buy some cheap offerings at the upcoming Goods Market. 
Chat_Event_GOODS_MARKET[P] |= It is Market Day soon. It is a chance to stock up on the simple things in life.

Chat_Event_GOODS_MARKET[J] |= Oh, I am all excited about the upcoming Market Day! I love to snatch a bargain. I love it when things are cheap, like the budgie. It's all I can A. Ford. Yes, that is probably a reference.
Chat_Event_GOODS_MARKET[J] |= Going to the Goods Market soon? I love the hustle and bustle and rustle and fustle and er, grustle?
Chat_Event_GOODS_MARKET[J] |= I have one eye on my calendar for the upcoming Goods Market. The other eye I use to watch where I am going! Wahey!

Chat_Event_GOODS_MARKET[B] |= 상품 시장? 나는 절대 싸게 사지 않아. 싸면 두 번 사라고 하더군.
Chat_Event_GOODS_MARKET[B] |= 부자인 나는 다른 절반의 사람들이 어떻게 사는지 보기 위해 시장에 가는 것을 좋아해.
Chat_Event_GOODS_MARKET[B] |= 곧 상품 시장이야. 씨앗을 원한다면 괜찮지만 나는 최고급 씨앗만 구입해.

Chat_Event_GOODS_MARKET[Q] |= 아 맞다! 상품 시장이 다가와! 너를 보니 이상한 모양의 당근을 사야겠다는 생각이 들었어.
Chat_Event_GOODS_MARKET[Q] |= 무슨 일? 무슨 일인지 말해줄게! 시장이 열릴거야. 지금 말고. 내 말은, 특히 네가 씨앗과 사과를 좋아한다면 가볼 만한 곳이야.
Chat_Event_GOODS_MARKET[Q] |= 나에게 G를 줘! O를 줘. O를 하나 더 줘. D를 줘! 이제 S! 아, 그건 버려. 우리의 단어 예산은 이런 일에는 국한되지 않아. 곧 상품 시장이 온다. 그것이 네가 알아야 할 전부야.

Chat_Event_GOODS_MARKET[C] |= Oh no. It's the Goods Market soon. I will likely arrive late and be left with the worst stuff.
Chat_Event_GOODS_MARKET[C] |= It's the Goods market soon. I wish they would actually sell decent stuff. I have cupboards stuffed with cheap seeds.
Chat_Event_GOODS_MARKET[C] |= I was thinking of not going to the Goods market when it is on. Too much noise.

Chat_Event_TRAVELLING_TRADER |= Have you seen the Travelling Trader? His boar is absolutely huge. They are a special breed from the deepest northern lands. It is said Morwenna bred them for riding.
Chat_Event_TRAVELLING_TRADER |= Trader day tomorrow. Bring your Brass and plenty of it!
Chat_Event_TRAVELLING_TRADER |= It's the Travelling Trader tomorrow. He always goes to the same two places in the haven, so be there or be a triangle.

Chat_Event_TRAVELLING_TRADER[P] |= The Travelling Trader is around tomorrow. It's a good chance to get some unique offerings at inflated prices.
Chat_Event_TRAVELLING_TRADER[P] |= I am anticipating the Travelling Trader arriving tomorrow. It must be a good life, wandering under the stars.
Chat_Event_TRAVELLING_TRADER[P] |= Are you getting anything from the Travelling Trader when he arrives tomorrow? I once bought a collection of Effigies. They really capture our beloved Goddesses' essence.

Chat_Event_TRAVELLING_TRADER[J] |= Well, I am excited to see what the Travelling Trader brings tomorrow!
Chat_Event_TRAVELLING_TRADER[J] |= Don't forget the Travelling Trader comes tomorrow. I hope he has some great goods! I love a treat.
Chat_Event_TRAVELLING_TRADER[J] |= I wonder what the Travelling Trader's boar eats? It must go through food like a... erm... massive pig.

Chat_Event_TRAVELLING_TRADER[B] |= That Travelling Trader has a huge boar, they say. Call that huge? My slippers are bigger than that.
Chat_Event_TRAVELLING_TRADER[B] |= The Travelling Trader wanders the land, but I still reckon I have been to more places.
Chat_Event_TRAVELLING_TRADER[B] |= People get excited about the Travelling Trader. His goods aren't that great. I find better stuff behind my larder.

Chat_Event_TRAVELLING_TRADER[Q] |= The Travelling Trader is due tomorrow. That boar is so well toilet trained. Although I bet it could fertilise your crops for a year in one go!
Chat_Event_TRAVELLING_TRADER[Q] |= I was just singing the Travelling Trader song in my head. 'One potato, two potato, three potato, four. You can't buy potatoes from the giant boar!"
Chat_Event_TRAVELLING_TRADER[Q] |= I wonder what the Travelling Trader will bring tomorrow. Apart from his gigantic boar. I once got 50% off a bucket. It was just the handle.

Chat_Event_TRAVELLING_TRADER[C] |= I just discovered that the Travelling Traders who set up near the combat woods sell items to help with fighting! Smart business, that!
Chat_Event_TRAVELLING_TRADER[C] |= I think the Travelling Trader over-prices his items on purpose to get more profit.
Chat_Event_TRAVELLING_TRADER[C] |= I really hate it when the Travelling Trader comes. He leaves his boar parked in awkward places. Do you really need to ride something that big? I have a 4x4, which is perfectly sized plank of wood.

Chat_Event_DRUIDA_DAY |= It's Goddess Day tomorrow so don't forget to bring offerings and get some blessings!
Chat_Event_DRUIDA_DAY |= Remember it is Goddess Day in the morrow. Stock up on offerings and plan your blessings.
Chat_Event_DRUIDA_DAY |= I am looking forward to our weekly celebration of Goddess love tomorrow.

Chat_Event_DRUIDA_DAY[P] |= It's the best day of the week tomorrow! Goddess Day! I always dress in my very best, which due to pixel budgets, is exactly the same as my weekly wear.
Chat_Event_DRUIDA_DAY[P] |= Goddess Day is nigh! The dancing, the offerings, the prayers, the tingle of fear and sense of dread that you might have upset them!
Chat_Event_DRUIDA_DAY[P] |= I am preparing my offerings for Goddess Day tomorrow. I want a good blessing but can never decide which!

Chat_Event_DRUIDA_DAY[J] |= Hurray! Goddess Day is nearly upon us. I love to do a bit of dancing or to the casual observer, shaking about a bit.
Chat_Event_DRUIDA_DAY[J] |= Are you going to Goddess Day? I love the atmosphere, and it's an excuse to eat and drink more.
Chat_Event_DRUIDA_DAY[J] |= Nearly Goddess Day! It's great to know our Goddesses are watching us and judging our dancing ability. I have the Eggs-Factor!

Chat_Event_DRUIDA_DAY[B] |= Tomorrow is Goddess Day. As usual, I will be offering only the best.
Chat_Event_DRUIDA_DAY[B] |= Goddess Day tomorrow. A chance for worship. I am sure many people secretly worship me too.
Chat_Event_DRUIDA_DAY[B] |= If you do any dancing at Goddess Day tomorrow, just try not to be outshone by my brilliance.

Chat_Event_DRUIDA_DAY[Q] |= I am thinking about what I can offer tomorrow for Goddess Day. Last week the apple I offered had a worm in it, so I saw that as a bonus.
Chat_Event_DRUIDA_DAY[Q] |= Goddess Day tomorrow. What's the weirdest thing you ever offered? I once offered a toad-in-the-hole I had baked myself. Sadly, the toad ate the pudding in the offering bowl, and I spent the next week only able to ribbit. 
Chat_Event_DRUIDA_DAY[Q] |= Goddess Day is nigh! Why aren't there 7 Goddesses? There are 7 days of the week. I suppose if there were 7, we would need an 8th day to celebrate them. Then you go down a big rabbit hole!

Chat_Event_DRUIDA_DAY[C] |= Oh dear. Goddess Day tomorrow. I don't mind the offerings, but some people get too drunk, and their dancing is dreadful. 
Chat_Event_DRUIDA_DAY[C] |= Having to make offerings every week is really expensive!
Chat_Event_DRUIDA_DAY[C] |= Oh no. It's Goddess Day tomorrow. Some people just get too loud.

Chat_Event_SHEEP_RACING |= I am going to the Sheep Racing tomorrow. Are you going? A good chance to meet folks and have fun.
Chat_Event_SHEEP_RACING |= It's nearly time for the Sheep Racing. They never seem to be as fast as when you ride them.
Chat_Event_SHEEP_RACING |= Are you going to go and watch the Sheep Racing tomorrow?

Chat_Event_SHEEP_RACING[P] |= It is the Sheep Racing at FineFayre tomorrow. Goddesses bless those lovely woolly creatures.
Chat_Event_SHEEP_RACING[P] |= I might attend the Sheep Racing at FineFayre, which is a bit frivolous, but the Goddesses seem to enjoy it.
Chat_Event_SHEEP_RACING[P] |= It is the Sheep Racing event tomorrow. A chance to earn money for offerings.

Chat_Event_SHEEP_RACING[J] |= It's Sheep Racing Day tomorrow! I just love watching those fluffy fellas frolicking to the flag!
Chat_Event_SHEEP_RACING[J] |= Have you tried to win a prize on the Sheep Racing? I always pick the fastest. Not sure how that works, though.
Chat_Event_SHEEP_RACING[J] |= Don't forget the Sheep Racing tomorrow. There are prizes for those who know their bacon!

Chat_Event_SHEEP_RACING[B] |= Sheep Racing soon. I used to breed the champion. Well, she would have been had I actually raced her.
Chat_Event_SHEEP_RACING[B] |= I find Sheep Racing doesn't pay out enough to be worth my time.
Chat_Event_SHEEP_RACING[B] |= Sheep Racing tomorrow. Mellowbrook's finest contribution to culture.

Chat_Event_SHEEP_RACING[Q] |= Are you going to the Sheep Racing tomorrow? I count sheep to get to sleep and even then they lose.
Chat_Event_SHEEP_RACING[Q] |= I am thinking about wasting my time on Sheep Racing tomorrow. Am sure there must be SOME logic behind which one to pick!
Chat_Event_SHEEP_RACING[Q] |= Are EWE going to the Sheep Racing in FineFayre tomorrow? I made what they call a pun. Did EWE get it? No? BAH!

Chat_Event_SHEEP_RACING[C] |= Apparently, it is the Sheep Racing tomorrow. It's about as fun as watching paint dry, which is actually not as fun as it sounds.
Chat_Event_SHEEP_RACING[C] |= I was considering wasting Brass on some prize-winning tomorrow at the Sheep Races. I may as well just toss the money into the river.
Chat_Event_SHEEP_RACING[C] |= Have you been to the Sheep Racing in FineFayre? Mellowfield's worst kept secret because you can smell it from Pineshade.

Chat_Event_SHEEP_AUCTION |= It's the Sheep Auction at FineFayre tomorrow if bidding on sheep is your thing.
Chat_Event_SHEEP_AUCTION |= Ram, ewe and lamb. All are available at the upcoming Sheep Auction!
Chat_Event_SHEEP_AUCTION |= It's nearly Sheep Auction time. Keep an eye on the date if you want to get involved.

Chat_Event_SHEEP_AUCTION[P] |= It is the Sheep Auction soon. I don't have much time for such things. My mind is on our great Goddesses. 
Chat_Event_SHEEP_AUCTION[P] |= Sheep Auction is on tomorrow. Not my cup of hot water poured on herbs.
Chat_Event_SHEEP_AUCTION[P] |= As a fellow Quillian, it is my duty to remind you of the Sheep Auction tomorrow. I mean, the auction is tomorrow... I am not reminding you tomorrow.

Chat_Event_SHEEP_AUCTION[J] |= Are you going to bid on some of our ovine friends tomorrow? They make great grass cutters and excellent nap pillows!
Chat_Event_SHEEP_AUCTION[J] |= I love the Sheep Auction! You can get a proper BAAGAIN! Wahey!
Chat_Event_SHEEP_AUCTION[J] |= Have you ever bought a sheep from the auction? It's on tomorrow if you want to try and understand what in Quill is going on!

Chat_Event_SHEEP_AUCTION[B] |= I feel like going to the Sheep Auction tomorrow and just buying all the sheep because I like to win. I won't though as I am too busy to look after them.
Chat_Event_SHEEP_AUCTION[B] |= I probably won't go to the upcoming Sheep Auction as it's unfair to the rest of you.
Chat_Event_SHEEP_AUCTION[B] |= If I were to go to the Sheep Auction I would likely buy only the very best because that's how I ride.

Chat_Event_SHEEP_AUCTION[Q] |= It's the Sheep Auction tomorrow in FineFayre. I once got over-excited and bid 30 Brass. Luckily, they were very supportive about my mistake.
Chat_Event_SHEEP_AUCTION[Q] |= I once got so excited at the Sheep Auction I stood up to shout my bid, and my pants fell down. I nearly dropped the ball on that one!
Chat_Event_SHEEP_AUCTION[Q] |= I once bought a sheep at the Sheep Auction. It was actually tiny when I sheared the wool off. It was lamb dressed as mutton!

Chat_Event_SHEEP_AUCTION[C] |= I would not bother going to the Sheep Auction tomorrow if I were you. You will get fleeced.
Chat_Event_SHEEP_AUCTION[C] |= Oh, it's that time of the week again. Sheep Auctions. I don't like them. Auctions, that is. Sheep are funny.
Chat_Event_SHEEP_AUCTION[C] |= I am never bidding at the Sheep Auction again. I can't count past 10, so I made a number up, and bought a sheep called Ewegene for Floppity Ploppity Eight.

Chat_Event_CHICKEN_RACING |= It's nearly time for the Chicken Racing. They never seem to be as fast as when you ride them.
Chat_Event_CHICKEN_RACING |= Are you going to spend some hard-earned money on the Chicken Racing tomorrow?
Chat_Event_CHICKEN_RACING |= Are you going to the Chicken Racing tomorrow? I love to suck on a Candy Hare and scream the name of my chosen clucker.

Chat_Event_CHICKEN_RACING[P] |= It is the Chicken Racing at Festfield tomorrow. Goddesses bless those little cluckers.
Chat_Event_CHICKEN_RACING[P] |= I might attend the Chicken Racing at FestField, which is surely our Goddesses' favourite sport.
Chat_Event_CHICKEN_RACING[P] |= It is the Chicken Racing event tomorrow. A chance to win prizes for gifts to offer.

Chat_Event_CHICKEN_RACING[J] |= It's Chicken Racing day tomorrow! Got to admire their determination!
Chat_Event_CHICKEN_RACING[J] |= Have you tried Chicken Racing? I always choose the one with the longest legs.
Chat_Event_CHICKEN_RACING[J] |= Don't forget the Chicken Racing tomorrow. There's a chance to get some pies and such!

Chat_Event_CHICKEN_RACING[B] |= Chicken Racing soon. I nearly got into the breeding game, but the feathers made me sneeze.
Chat_Event_CHICKEN_RACING[B] |= I find Chicken Racing doesn't have nice enough food prizes to be worth my time. I would say the same for pig and sheep racing.
Chat_Event_CHICKEN_RACING[B] |= Chicken Racing tomorrow. Summerdown's finest contribution to entertainment since the unfortunate incident with the grease barrel.

Chat_Event_CHICKEN_RACING[Q] |= I always watch the Chicken Racing when it is on. You should try it, especially as someone put effort into making it.
Chat_Event_CHICKEN_RACING[Q] |= I am going to watch the Chicken Racing tomorrow. It's great to egg them on. I take eggs to throw at those who don't win.
Chat_Event_CHICKEN_RACING[Q] |= I am going to the Chicken Racing tomorrow. Are you going? A good chance to meet money and lose folks.

Chat_Event_CHICKEN_RACING[C] |= Apparently, it is the Chicken Racing tomorrow. It's about as fun as counting snowflakes in a blizzard.
Chat_Event_CHICKEN_RACING[C] |= I was considering wasting Brass tomorrow at the Chicken Racing. I may as well just melt down my Brass and make a disc I can throw off a cliff.
Chat_Event_CHICKEN_RACING[C] |= Have you been to the Chicken Racing in FestField? It's just an annoying cacophony of aggressive fowl and shouting villagers.

Chat_Event_CHICKEN_AUCTION |= It's the Chicken Auction at FestField tomorrow. A good source of eggs.
Chat_Event_CHICKEN_AUCTION |= Don't forget the Chicken Auction is tomorrow. It's egg-citing!
Chat_Event_CHICKEN_AUCTION |= It's the Chicken Auction soon. FestField is a lovely place to visit.

Chat_Event_CHICKEN_AUCTION[P] |= It is the Chicken Auction soon. I would much rather be worshipping like the pious NPC I am.
Chat_Event_CHICKEN_AUCTION[P] |= Chicken Auction is on tomorrow. It's not my leather item holder.
Chat_Event_CHICKEN_AUCTION[P] |= Just reminding you of the Chicken Auction tomorrow. 

Chat_Event_CHICKEN_AUCTION[J] |= Are you going to bid on some of our clucking friends tomorrow? I buy them by the featherweight.
Chat_Event_CHICKEN_AUCTION[J] |= I love the Chicken Auction! You can get a proper BAAGAIN! Oh, hang on, that's sheep.
Chat_Event_CHICKEN_AUCTION[J] |= Have you ever bought a Chicken from the auction? It's on tomorrow if you want to try shouting numbers at a man who talks gibberish.

Chat_Event_CHICKEN_AUCTION[B] |= I feel like going to the Chicken Auction tomorrow and just buying all the chickens so I can monopolise eggs and corner the market. 
Chat_Event_CHICKEN_AUCTION[B] |= I probably won't go to the upcoming Chicken Auction as it's beneath me. Not geographically, of course!
Chat_Event_CHICKEN_AUCTION[B] |= If I were to go to the Chicken Auction, I would easily outbid anyone due to my ability to count past 20.

Chat_Event_CHICKEN_AUCTION[Q] |= It's the Chicken Auction tomorrow in FestField. I once won and paid in coins I had cleaned with soap. They refused to accept laundered money.
Chat_Event_CHICKEN_AUCTION[Q] |= I once got so excited at the Chicken Auction that I threw my money pouch into the chicken pen, and they ate it all. The change did them good.
Chat_Event_CHICKEN_AUCTION[Q] |= I once bought a sheep at the Chicken Auction. It was the same day I gave up drinking.

Chat_Event_CHICKEN_AUCTION[C] |= I would not bother going to the Chicken Auction tomorrow. Mainly because I want to win for once.
Chat_Event_CHICKEN_AUCTION[C] |= Chicken and chicks and cider bread. Tell me why I don't like auction days. 
Chat_Event_CHICKEN_AUCTION[C] |= I am never bidding at the Chicken Auction again. Last time, I got a cockerel with a faulty alarm and got woken at 3am.

Chat_HowAreYou[B] |= 잘하고 있어!

Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER |= Busy! Busy! I can't talk right now!
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER |= Hammering this. Nailing that.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER |= Just beavering away on this project. 
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER |= The smell of sawdust and the sound of hard work.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER |= A good deal of building things.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER |= Making good progress on this task you set.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER |= Just busy with this interesting project.

Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[P] |= Just having a stretch and a sip of water. It's hard work, and it's thirsty work.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[P] |= I need to get some nails; otherwise, it's nose to the grindstone.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[P] |= The magnificence of creation is what is happening!
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[P] |= I can tell you what's going on in rhyme - Wood and stone, skin and bone, makes a structure, makes a home. Isn't that nice?
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[P] |= I am humming thankful tunes in honour of the Goddesses as I work.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[P] |= Another construction is being made in honour of our Goddesses.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[P] |= Doing Blessed work.

Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[Q] |= I just had a slight snooze to reinvigorate myself for this hard work.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[Q] |= Working 9 to 6. What a way to make a living.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[Q] |= Just making sure this structure is conforming to Elf & Safety requirements.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[Q] |= Hibblepips keep stealing the nails! They must be short of iron!
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[Q] |= I am re-adjusting the wedging on this doobie-dah. I have no idea, either.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[Q] |= I am looking for my saw. I can't recall where I last erm, what's the word? 
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[Q] |= I was just discussing with myself if it was sandwich time or not. I decided it was.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[Q] |= I am just going to sharpen my hammer.

Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[J] |= I'm making good progress with this build.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[J] |= Well, I was considering a sneaky break until you showed up asking questions *wink*.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[J] |= Just varnished something, and now I'm going to varnish the varnish.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[J] |= Building for my good pal. 
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[J] |= I have a bit more to do yet, but going well!
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[J] |= I am enjoying knocking up this structure!
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[J] |= The joys of creation!

Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[C] |= 도와달라고 부탁한 작업을 진행 중이야...
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[C] |= 도와주려고 허리에 무리를 하고 있어. 내가 널 좋아해서 다행이야!
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[C] |= 엄지 손가락에서 파편을 빼고 있어.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[C] |= 작업 곡을 흥얼거리고 있었어. 누군가 나한테 닥치라고 소리치더군.

Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[C] |= 예술적 차이. 난 빨간색으로 칠하고 싶은데 다른 사람들은 평평하게 칠하고 싶어해.

Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[B] |= Great work is happening, that's what.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[B] |= It's going up pretty well. You will be pleased with the final results.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[B] |= I am working hard so I can play hard later. That's how us mossy stones roll.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[B] |= Not much is happening if you keep distracting the talent.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[B] |= Not much longer, and you can cut the ribbon on this beauty.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[B] |= I am doing brilliant building.
Chat_Happening_FNFWORKER[B] |= I am just showing off my amazing construction skills.

Chat_Happening_HOMELESS |= I'm hoping you might be able to get some friends and family together to repair my house.
Chat_Happening_HOMELESS |= I'm staying in the Emergency Shelter as Hobs have attacked and wrecked my house. Maybe you could help put it right?
Chat_Happening_HOMELESS |= Being homeless, that's what's happening. I need someone to repair my Hob-damaged home.
Chat_Happening_HOMELESS |= I'm wondering when I might get back into my destroyed home. The Shelter is fine, but I need to get back soon.
Chat_Happening_HOMELESS |= The Hobs came out of the bushes and smashed my home up. I'm now living in the Emergency Shelter. When will these Hob attacks end?
Chat_Happening_HOMELESS[P] |= The Goddesses must be looking the other way whilst these Hobs are smashing up our homes. What did I do wrong? When will it end?
Chat_Happening_HOMELESS[P] |= Blessed will be the one who helps repair my damaged home. I wish I could move back in.
Chat_Happening_HOMELESS[P] |= The Emergency Shelter is fine, but it certainly wasn't based on Opal. My house is much closer to the Goddesses, but I can't live there now.
Chat_Happening_HOMELESS[P] |= I went for a stroll past my destroyed house earlier. It broke my heart to see it like that. Maybe the Goddesses will find someone to help fix it up again.
Chat_Happening_HOMELESS[P] |= I should have given better offerings. That must be why the Hobs smashed up my house and made me homeless.
Chat_Happening_HOMELESS[Q] |= I'm pretending that I'm back in my house, Hobs didn't smash up, and I'm reading a book by the fire.
Chat_Happening_HOMELESS[Q] |= Everything is happening, if everything is being homeless and living in the Emergency Shelter with Cyril, that is.
Chat_Happening_HOMELESS[Q] |= I'm wondering what I need to do to get someone to fix my Hob-damaged house. Beg, plead, dress up as a Jabberwock?
Chat_Happening_HOMELESS[Q] |= It's one of those days where I wish I had more friends with hammers and wood. To fix up my home, you see?
Chat_Happening_HOMELESS[Q] |= Ssshhh! Hear that? Exactly. The sound of nobody rushing to fix my house up!
Chat_Happening_HOMELESS[J] |= I'm keeping my spirits up despite being homeless and living in Cyril's Emergency Shelter. The Hobs, you see. They smashed the place up, and now I'm homeless.
Chat_Happening_HOMELESS[J] |= It's so dull having to live in the Emergency Shelter. At least it is close to the Tavern, though!
Chat_Happening_HOMELESS[J] |= I am having a break from joviality. How can I be jovial when the Hobs chose to smash my house up? They have no sense of humour, that lot.
Chat_Happening_HOMELESS[J] |= I'm trying to keep my spirits up despite being the victim of a Hob attack. They are happening more and more regularly, and I was just unlucky, I guess. I'm trying to keep my spirits up at the Emergency Shelter. I just wish I could get someone to repair my place.
Chat_Happening_HOMELESS[J] |= All my joke books are back at my house. Yes, the house which is boarded up and not safe to enter following the Hob attack.
Chat_Happening_HOMELESS[B] |= I may be homeless, but I'm welcome everywhere, including the Emergency Shelter. Cyril found me the comfiest bed, of course.
Chat_Happening_HOMELESS[B] |= The Hobs attacked my house; of course, they did. It is the finest house in Quill. There's no point in them bothering with some of the other shacks around here, is there? I want to get back if you could help restore it to its former glory, <PlayerName>?
Chat_Happening_HOMELESS[B] |= The Hobs know I'm important around here, so they smashed my place up while I was shopping. Little brutes. Can you help get me back by repairing my house?
Chat_Happening_HOMELESS[B] |= The calm before the storm. The storm of villagers rushing to help me repair my house once they here that Hobs have attacked me.
Chat_Happening_HOMELESS[B] |= I'm cheering everybody up around the Emergency Shelter with my presence, but I do wish someone would help me get back home. Just a few villagers could repair it in no time, if you asked them.
Chat_Happening_HOMELESS[C] |= Why me? Why did they smash up my house? And why has nobody gone over there to fix it yet, eh <PlayerName>?
Chat_Happening_HOMELESS[C] |= I wish I could get back to my house, but the Hobs have smashed it up. I'm tired of staying at the Emergency Shelter.
Chat_Happening_HOMELESS[C] |= What's happening, <PlayerName>? I'll tell you what - my back can't stand another night of sleeping on Cyril's Emergency Shelter bed. Talk about lumpy! Can you go to my house and fix it up?
Chat_Happening_HOMELESS[C] |= Nothing is happening, <PlayerName>. That's the problem. My house is uninhabitable, and I need someone to go fix it.
Chat_Happening_HOMELESS[C] |= What's happening? I need someone to raise a group of friends to fix up my Hob damaged house. Someone like you, <PlayerName>!


Chat_HowAreYou_Tip |= 너의 머리 속에 있는 새터웨이를 보고 있었어. 정말 놀라운 생물이야. 네가 가야 할 곳을 안내주지.
Chat_HowAreYou_Tip |= 기분이 좋아서 방금 달력을 확인했어. 누구의 생일이 다가오는지 확인하고 싶어서.
Chat_HowAreYou_Tip |= 아주 잘 지내고 있어, 고마워. 새로운 재료를 찾을 수 있도록 더 많은 속담을 발견하려고 노력하고 있어.
Chat_HowAreYou_Tip |= 난 괜찮아. 고마워. 늘 '도전'을 하고 있dj. 나는 작은 일을 스스로 설정하고, 그것을 완수하면 좋은 보상을 받지. 발전하는 것이 좋아.
Chat_HowAreYou_Tip |= I tried to milk a cow earlier and forgot I needed a Jar or Bucket. Now, I've just got to use one when stood next to a cow.
Chat_HowAreYou_Tip |= I was wishing I had the skills of the Masters. Gardening, fishing, combat - it would be amazing to master them all!
Chat_HowAreYou_Tip |= I was thinking of growing more produce. Plant some seeds and water daily, and you are good to go. 
Chat_HowAreYou_Tip |= I just hurt my back, chopping those wood trees down. At least I can now build something, though.
Chat_HowAreYou_Tip |= Ahhhh! I pulled a muscle swinging my pickaxe at one of those little stone quarry holes. I can build something with the stone, but I'm not sure what. Maybe fix something up?
Chat_HowAreYou_Tip |= I am aching from being thrown off a pig. It must have been in a bad mood. I should have fed it first!
Chat_HowAreYou_Tip |= I am feeling better. Cheers for asking. I recently went to the Apothecary and cured some annoying Traits I had picked up. Each Trait has an opposite, so a positive will remove a negative - and vice versa.
Chat_HowAreYou_Tip |= I was happy to win a recent auction. I paid just ☎3 for a chicken! It's a pity it then ran off and left me with egg on my face.
Chat_HowAreYou_Tip |= I am stretching my legs, but maybe I should start considering using the Goddess Statues to get around.
Chat_HowAreYou_Tip |= I feel better after a nice bowl of soup. Easy to make. Just stop the pointer on the hole and repeat for the other ingredients.
Chat_HowAreYou_Tip |= I am full after eating a delicious stew. I know that the trick is to make sure you time the three hourglasses to finish at the same time. Choose the ingredient with the most sand first!
Chat_HowAreYou_Tip |= Hmmm. I had a lovely pudding. Easy to make, too. Just got to time it right when it's in the kiln. Hit the green!
Chat_HowAreYou_Tip |= I am satiated from a nice sandwich. Just time that kiln, and you are good to go!
Chat_HowAreYou_Tip |= I am filled with the wonders of bread. I can hit the green zones on the kiln every time. Practice makes perfect, but the higher the Star Rating of the ingredients, the harder it is!
Chat_HowAreYou_Tip |= I am thrilled with a pie I made earlier. I rolled out the pastry, covered the bowl perfectly, and then timed the kiln to perfection!
Chat_HowAreYou_Tip |= I am sticky after eating jam. Jam is tricky to make. You need to use the lever to keep the heat in the centre. Then, watch for the temperature drop as you add new ingredients.
Chat_HowAreYou_Tip |= I'm good, thanks, after a lovely nap at a campfire. When I woke up, it was hours later.
Chat_HowAreYou_Tip |= When I wanted to take more control of my life, "You should try the Accessibility settings", is what my mother advised!
Chat_HowAreYou_Tip |= I lack energy after doing some serious building. You need to make sure people working on construction have plenty of energy!
Chat_HowAreYou_Tip |= I am feeling OK, thanks, but I wish I had one of those legendary 'Stat Nuts' to boost myself even more. 
Chat_HowAreYou_Tip |= I feel good after eating some lovely Sweet Moss. You can get it by pouring honey on special tree stumps. Return the next day with a sickle, and sweetness is yours!
Chat_HowAreYou_Tip |= I am feeling perky today. Speaking of Perks, did you know businesses can get Perks that improve them? Check the Ledger and raise your REP to unlock Perk Points to spend. Sorry! I misted over a minute there! Did I say anything weird?
Chat_HowAreYou_Tip |= I am as grumpy as an underpaid and overworked shop worker today. Fair pay and high energy might help me out!
Chat_HowAreYou_Tip |= I was just thinking about workers who get fired. They don't hold grudges for long. A few gifts can help raise their mood.
Chat_HowAreYou_Tip |= I am feeling perky and virile. If I had a rabbit corndoll right now, I would fancy my chances of conception.
Chat_HowAreYou_Tip |= I feel much wiser today. I was reading some books from my bookshelf, which was very beneficial. Anyone with a family should encourage them to study. Intelligence helps improve Experience, as they say.
Chat_HowAreYou_Tip |= I was thinking of buying an Honesty Box to sell my spare goods. You should think about buying one, too.
Chat_HowAreYou_Tip |= I was pondering Divorce. The High Priest of Loverwood offers a Divorce service for ☎500. That's not the most spiritual way to do things, but I hear it works.

Chat_Happening_Tip |= 인생의 진척도를 확인하고 있었어. 진행 화면에서 언제든지 너의 상태를 확인할 수 있어. 만족스러울 수도 있지.
Chat_Happening_Tip |= 다른 마을 사람들과 수다를 떨며 수집한 아이템의 별 등급을 높이려고. 더 좋은 아이템을 얻기 위해 필요한 조건을 확인하는 것이 좋아. 동료 마을 사람들은 훌륭한 팁의 원천이지.
Chat_Happening_Tip |= I was making a map. They help you find your way around and see where folks you know live. You can even mark dating spots on them!
Chat_Happening_Tip |= I was using my sickle earlier, and I suddenly got extra yield! Those tools can really get efficient with use!
Chat_Happening_Tip |= I was considering all my friend's birthdays. It is always best to get them a gift for a huge friendship boost! They love it when you remember the date.
Chat_Happening_Tip |= I was just looking at my various tools. They improve the more you use them and give all sorts of benefits. You should look at them in your backpack and see how good they are.
Chat_Happening_Tip |= I was thinking about Talents. We all have them. It's worth discovering what Talents people have, especially if they are family, as it might help you one day.
Chat_Happening_Tip |= I'm doing some tasks. It helps to pin them in your journal for ones you don't want to forget.
Chat_Happening_Tip |= I am trying to build friendships with various folks. I want to gain access to their crop patches and berry bushes! Maybe I might want to date and marry them too!
Chat_Happening_Tip |= I tried to get a dog to find me digspots, but it seemed to be in a bad mood.
Chat_Happening_Tip |= I'm considering going to the Goods Store and selling some items there. Those Selling Units in the corner are great for bulk-selling.
Chat_Happening_Tip |= I found some Zinc Ore. Did you know that different ores have different effects on the things you make from them?
Chat_Happening_Tip |= 아까 우물에 비친 내 모습을 보고 있었어. 병이나 양동이가 있었다면 내 얼굴과 상호작용하며 물을 채울 수 있었을 거야. 물로 채우는 거지.
Chat_Happening_Tip |= I was just looking at my Fishing Map! I got it from Twig, the Master Fisherman. He helps me progress my Skills. In the Fishing Map tab, I can open my local map and see what fish live in a locale. It's great!
Chat_Happening_Tip |= Do you have a Pet whistle? Use <whistle>to summon or send your pets home. It's very handy!
Chat_Happening_Tip |= I was thinking of going digging. I need a dog and a shovel. Thinking about it, shovels make me sneeze, so maybe not.
Chat_Happening_Tip |= I was trying to recall what people said to me. If only I had a Chat History, perhaps on an NPC Status screen. Where did that come from?!
Chat_Happening_Tip |= Broken bridges, shattered statues, ruined houses. It's great to fix things with friends.
Chat_Happening_Tip |= I was considering which offerings to make next Goddess Day. Those blessings can be very useful!
Chat_Happening_Tip |= You have a lot of land on that farm of yours. Are you making it pretty, or are you making it productive, you know, to make money?
Chat_Happening_Tip |= I went for a walk earlier to see if any more ruined houses around needed repairing. 
Chat_Happening_Tip |= I was considering changing the layout of my house. Maybe put in a new wall or move stuff around.
Chat_Happening_Tip |= I've been practising my Parrying. With the right timing on a Block, you can deflect certain enemy attacks and even open them up for a counter-attack!
Chat_Happening_Tip |= Not much is happening here. I don't have any building projects to check on. It's worth using the sign by the construction to check on your workers. Sorry, friends...
Chat_Happening_Tip |= I was going to use a windmill to grind some flour, but there was no wind! Need wind to grind!
Chat_Happening_Tip |= I'm considering painting my house. A dash of colour can brighten up the place. Painting works on many items, too! 
Chat_Happening_Tip |= I just realised that all businesses have a stock cupboard in them. You can place your spare items in them and even order new stock. Miraculous!
Chat_Happening_Tip |= I heard a low whisper near one of those henges. I heard they are Fae doorways that open if you shine a magical light onto them.
Chat_Happening_Tip |= I dreamt I was getting married. I cooked the Pie of You and I and gave it to the High Priest in Loverwood. I was just about to give my love the Binding Band he gave me when I woke up.
Chat_Happening_Tip |= I found a Corndoll. Gifting one to your spouse can trigger the Wheel of Delight. I will keep this one under my bed.
Chat_Happening_Tip |= I was just walking along and spotted a strange bush. It was hard to notice at first, but I reckon Fae folk use such bushes to move around.
Chat_Happening_Tip |= Someone just told me that businesses can order goods from their stock cupboard. Sounds handy for keeping the shelves full or gaining materials.
Chat_Happening_Tip |= I was reading about the Village Shelter and how they can house people who have been displaced and need their homes to be repaired.
Chat_Happening_Tip |= I dreamt I owned a huge shop and sold it by opening my Ledger, then viewing all Ledgers. Dull dream, huh?
Chat_Happening_Tip |= I was chatting in the local shop about work schedules. People who work need a rest now and then. Even being underpaid can demoralise them.
Chat_Happening_Tip |= I was thinking about a trip to Simplewood but am not yet fully prepared. It's best to take a Ward, Charm, maybe a second weapon - and some meal and combat items!
Chat_Happening_Tip |= I heard that the deeper you go into a Dark Forest, the tougher the monsters you face. The rewards, though - ooooh, better quality loot!
Chat_Happening_Tip |= I heard some fella had gone into Midwood and got badly hurt. He found a campfire and managed to heal himself. He then found he was deeper in the forest, though, and got badly hurt even more!
Chat_Happening_Tip |= I heard that someone got rescued from Simplewood. They were in the very last area of that forest. Lucky to survive!
Chat_Happening_Tip |= I recently went to The Shoe, north of Homesteads. I like to hear the sound of laughter from the children there. I hope they all get adopted.
Chat_Happening_Tip |= I was just talking to a friend about the famous Witchhunter in Quill who gives good rewards for monster-slaying. He turns up during opening hours at Homestead's tavern at night. 
Chat_Happening_Tip |= I was hoping that our local businesses might start to specialise a bit. A shop owner can make a robust business by focusing on specific items and getting new sets of Perks!
Chat_Happening_Tip |= Did you know you can set your family to do different tasks with the Family Scheduler? They can help around the house, gather, and do many things. It's handy.
Chat_Happening_Tip |= Earlier today, I found a Naming Nut and was thinking of funny pet names I could give an animal after feeding it the nut.
Chat_Happening_Tip |= 무슨 일인지 말해줄게! 난 'BOLD AS BRASS'라는 가게를 가지고 싶어. 상점의 장부 화면에서 모든 장부를 확인하면 사업 이름을 쉽게 변경할 수 있지. 이제 브라스를 좀 만들어야겠어!
Chat_Happening_Tip |= The High Priest blessed my water, but I also heard you can get special water in the Faery fountains of Tir Na Nog.
