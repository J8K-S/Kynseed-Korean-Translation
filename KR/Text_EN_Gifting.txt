ChatGift_Fruit[Dislike] |= Oh great, more fresh food. Just what I needed...
ChatGift_Fruit[Neutral] |= Thanks for that. It will come in handy.
ChatGift_Fruit[Friendly] |= Hey, thanks for the healthy snacks. You're alright.
ChatGift_Fruit[Like] |= Oh, healthy gifts? Thanks. You're a pretty decent friend.
ChatGift_Fruit[Love] |= Wow, you've certainly just given a tasty treat! You're the best!
ChatGift_Fish[Dislike] |= Fish? Fine, but don't expect me to jump with joy over it.
ChatGift_Fish[Neutral] |= Oh, fish? Thanks.
ChatGift_Fish[Friendly] |= Hey, fish! Thanks.
ChatGift_Fish[Like] |= Ah, fish. You're too kind. I appreciate it.
ChatGift_Fish[Love] |= Fish! You're the best. I can't thank you enough.
ChatGift_Herb[Dislike] |= Why'd you bother? Just some measly herb won't make any difference to me.
ChatGift_Herb[Neutral] |= I suppose I can't complain about free herbs. Not sure what I'll do with them, though.
ChatGift_Herb[Friendly] |= Thanks for this herb! I really appreciate the gesture. Maybe I'll find a way to put it to good use in my cooking.
ChatGift_Herb[Like] |= You know my taste. This herb will definitely enhance my dishes.
ChatGift_Herb[Love] |= Oh how kind, you got me a herb. I can't wait to use it in my next recipe.
ChatGift_Meal[Dislike] |= Thanks, I suppose, but don't think it means we're friends or anything.
ChatGift_Meal[Neutral] |= Hey, thanks a bunch. You really didn't have to, but I'm grateful.
ChatGift_Meal[Friendly] |= Hey, thanks a bunch! You really didn't have to, but I appreciate the gesture.
ChatGift_Meal[Like] |= Thanks a bunch; I really appreciate it. You're a pretty great person.
ChatGift_Meal[Love] |= You got this just for me? You're seriously the best! I can't wait to dive into this delicious meal. Thank you!
ChatGift_MiscFood[Dislike] |= Hmph, food? Do you think this will make me like you? Maybe.
ChatGift_MiscFood[Neutral] |= Oh, thanks for the food; I'm not one to complain.
ChatGift_MiscFood[Friendly] |= Oh, you brought me some food? That's thoughtful of you.
ChatGift_MiscFood[Like] |= I've gotta say, you know how to make me happy. Thanks.
ChatGift_MiscFood[Love] |= I can't believe you got me this to eat. You're incredible, thank you so much.
ChatGift_Seeds[Dislike] |= I guess it's better than nothing. Don't expect friendship miracles, though.
ChatGift_Seeds[Neutral] |= Oh, seeds? Thanks. I'll see what I can do with them.
ChatGift_Seeds[Friendly] |= That's thoughtful of you. I'll make sure to plant them and see what grows.
ChatGift_Seeds[Like] |= Thanks a bunch! I'll give them the best care and watch them bloom.
ChatGift_Seeds[Love] |=  I can't wait to nurture these and watch them flourish. Thank you!
ChatGift_Flower[Dislike] |= Oh great, a flower.
ChatGift_Flower[Neutral] |= Hmm, a flower. Thanks. It's quite nice, I guess.
ChatGift_Flower[Friendly] |= That's really sweet of you. Thanks a bunch.
ChatGift_Flower[Like] |= You got me a flower? That's awesome! You're alright, you know.
ChatGift_Flower[Love] |= You always know how to make me smile. I'm so lucky to know you.
ChatGift_Gift[Dislike] |= Is this another useless trinket? Or something worthwhile?
ChatGift_Gift[Neutral] |= Oh, thanks. I like it.
ChatGift_Gift[Friendly] |= Hey, thanks. That's really kind of you.
ChatGift_Gift[Like] |= Thanks a lot; I appreciate it.
ChatGift_Gift[Love] |= I can't believe you got this for me! You're amazing; thank you so much.
ChatGift_MiscItem[Dislike] |= I guess it's a gift - for whatever reason. Thanks, I suppose.
ChatGift_MiscItem[Neutral] |= Oh, you got me something. That's nice.
ChatGift_MiscItem[Friendly] |= Aw, that's really thoughtful. Thanks a bunch.
ChatGift_MiscItem[Like] |= Hey, you got me something. That's awesome. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.
ChatGift_MiscItem[Love] |= Oh wow, you got me a gift. You're the best. Thank you so much. I love it.
ChatGift_MonsterPart[Dislike] |= Well, I guess I'll take it. Not like I have a choice. I do kind of like it, but it does smell somewhat.
ChatGift_MonsterPart[Neutral] |= Well, would you look at that? A revolting monster part. Is it oozing?
ChatGift_MonsterPart[Friendly] |= Oh, wow! A monster part. You're too kind.
ChatGift_MonsterPart[Like] |= Hey, is that a monster part? Awesome!
ChatGift_MonsterPart[Love] |= I can't believe you got me a monster part. It's so nasty I love it! Thank you so much.
ChatGift_Tool[Dislike] |= Like, I don't have enough clutter already. Well, I'm sure I can find a use for it.
ChatGift_Tool[Neutral] |= A tool? Hmm, that might come in handy.
ChatGift_Tool[Friendly] |= Hey, thanks for the tool. That's thoughtful of you.
ChatGift_Tool[Like] |= Whoa, a new tool. I can't wait to try it out.
ChatGift_Tool[Love] |= You got me a tool! I can't believe how thoughtful you are. You're the best. I can't wait to use it.
ChatGift_Sword[Dislike] |= Just what I needed - in case I feel like hacking away at something. Any ideas?
ChatGift_Sword[Neutral] |= Thanks for the gift. It's always nice to receive something unexpected, and a weapon is certainly unexpected.
ChatGift_Sword[Friendly] |= Awesome. I can't wait to swing this around and show those Hobs who's boss.
ChatGift_Sword[Like] |= You got me a sword? That's really thoughtful of you. I feel safer in Quill already.
ChatGift_Sword[Love] |= You got me a sword? Now I can fight by your side and keep you safe. Thank you!
ChatGift_Dislike[Dislike] |= Seriously? You couldn't have picked something I actually like? Thanks for nothing.
ChatGift_Dislike[Neutral] |= Oh, great. Another thing I don't care about.
ChatGift_Dislike[Friendly] |= You know, I thought you knew me better than this. It's a bit disappointing, to say the least.
ChatGift_Dislike[Like] |= You know, I thought we were getting closer, but if you can't even look on the wiki to see what I like, well maybe I was wrong about you. *wink*
ChatGift_Dislike[Love] |= I can't believe you didn't know that I really don't like this. It's just sad to think you don't know me as well as I thought you did.
ChatGift_Favourite[Dislike] |= I can't say I expected much, but you got this one right. Thanks.
ChatGift_Favourite[Neutral] |= You might have some good taste after all. Thanks.
ChatGift_Favourite[Friendly] |= You really know how to put a smile on my face. Thanks, friend.
ChatGift_Favourite[Like] |= You're the best. Thanks for always being so thoughtful.
ChatGift_Favourite[Love] |= You mean so much to me, and this gift is a reminder of that!

ChatGift_Fruit[Dislike][P] |= Ah, more earthly sustenance? I suppose it's better than nothing.
ChatGift_Fruit[Neutral][P] |= Ah, natures humble produce. It shall provide sustenance on my journey.
ChatGift_Fruit[Friendly][P] |= Ah, a bountiful harvest. The Goddesses smile upon us.
ChatGift_Fruit[Like][P] |= Oh, a gift from the land, nourishing both body and soul.
ChatGift_Fruit[Love][P] |= Oh, a beautiful gift from the earth itself. Your thoughtfulness is unmatched.
ChatGift_Fish[Dislike][P] |= A slimy creature from the depths? I suppose it could be considered a blessing. 
ChatGift_Fish[Neutral][P] |= A fish, you say? It reminds me of the abundance of life in this world. 
ChatGift_Fish[Friendly][P] |= A symbol of life's fluidity. Many thanks, friend.

ChatGift_Herb[Friendly][P] |= A treasure bestowed by the Fae gardeners. Your gift shall not go unnoticed.
ChatGift_Herb[Like][P] |= A treasure with healing virtues. Your gesture fills me with gratitude.
ChatGift_Herb[Love][P] |= A herb, a gentle healer crafted by nature. Your presence in my life is a blessing indeed.

ChatGift_Meal[Neutral][P] |= A meal to nourish the body and sustain the spirit. Your generosity is noted.
ChatGift_Meal[Friendly][P] |= A well-prepared meal, a taste of the Goddesses grace. My sincerest gratitude.
ChatGift_Meal[Like][P] |= A divine feast. Your culinary skills rival Old Mother Hubbard's.
ChatGift_Meal[Love][P] |= A celestial banquet prepared by your skilled hands. You honour me with your culinary skills and your unwavering affection.
ChatGift_MiscFood[Dislike][P] |= Well, it's sustenance, I suppose. I'll give you a reluctant thanks.
ChatGift_MiscFood[Neutral][P] |= Accept my appreciation for this provision.
ChatGift_MiscFood[Friendly][P] |= A delightful offering of sustenance. It warms my heart to know you care.
ChatGift_MiscFood[Like][P] |= Oh, the sweetness of this gift. It feeds not only my hunger but also my soul.
ChatGift_MiscFood[Love][P] |= In this humble food, I taste the sweetness of nature.

ChatGift_Flower[Dislike][P] |= Flowers, huh? I suppose they have their beauty, but they wither so quickly.
ChatGift_Flower[Neutral][P] |= Flowers, delicate reminders of nature's artistry. I shall appreciate their fleeting beauty and offer thanks.
ChatGift_Flower[Friendly][P] |= Ah, flowers. Nature's artwork in full bloom.
ChatGift_Flower[Like][P] |= Fragrant messengers of love and beauty. Your thoughtfulness colours my world.
ChatGift_Flower[Love][P] |= Flowers that reflect the colours of our connection.
ChatGift_Gift[Dislike][P] |= Fine, I'll begrudgingly accept it.
ChatGift_Gift[Neutral][P] |= A gift, a token of your goodwill. I acknowledge your gesture and extend my measured appreciation.
ChatGift_Gift[Friendly][P] |= A gift. How thoughtful of you to bestow upon me this token of affection.
ChatGift_Gift[Like][P] |= A treasure wrapped in friendship's embrace.
ChatGift_Gift[Love][P] |= A gift that mirrors the depth of our affection.
ChatGift_MiscItem[Dislike][P] |= You have a strange way of showing appreciation. Here, take some half-hearted thanks.
ChatGift_MiscItem[Neutral][P] |= A practical item, indeed. I accept it as a useful addition to my possessions and offer my thanks.
ChatGift_MiscItem[Friendly][P] |= A practical item, a testament to your understanding of my needs. Your consideration fills me with gratitude.
ChatGift_MiscItem[Like][P] |= A practical item carefully chosen to ease my journey. Your unwavering support lifts my spirit.
ChatGift_MiscItem[Love][P] |= My dear, a practical item chosen with a clear understanding of my needs.
ChatGift_MonsterPart[Dislike][P] |= A gruesome trophy, right? I'll take it, but don't think I'm excited about possessing a piece of a foul creature.
ChatGift_MonsterPart[Neutral][P] |= A peculiar item, a remnant of a creature's existence. I accept it with mild curiosity.
ChatGift_MonsterPart[Friendly][P] |= A curious artefact, a piece of a fallen foe? Well, your shared triumph fills me with admiration.
ChatGift_MonsterPart[Like][P] |= A formidable token. Your bravery and camaraderie fill me with boundless joy.
ChatGift_MonsterPart[Love][P] |= You brave champion, a fragment of your conquests?
ChatGift_Tool[Dislike][P] |= So, you bring me a tool? Take some thanks, and leave me be.
ChatGift_Tool[Neutral][P] |= A tool, a means to shape the world around us. I acknowledge its usefulness and offer my appreciation.
ChatGift_Tool[Friendly][P] |= A tool, a companion in the pursuit of creation and progress.
ChatGift_Tool[Like][P] |= A wondrous instrument to unlock endless possibilities. Your gift fuels my passion for creation.
ChatGift_Tool[Love][P] |= I will use this tool to shape a world infused with our impressively high friendship level! Or to do odd jobs.
ChatGift_Sword[Dislike][P] |= A sword, huh? I suppose it's a symbol of strength, but I have no use for such violent instruments. 
ChatGift_Sword[Neutral][P] |= A sword, a weapon of both protection and destruction. I accept this symbol of power with cautious gratitude.
ChatGift_Sword[Friendly][P] |= A gleaming embodiment of courage and honour. Your gesture uplifts my spirit.
ChatGift_Sword[Like][P] |= A testament to your continued support and belief in me. You arm me with both protection and confidence.
ChatGift_Sword[Love][P] |= Well, this sword is sharper than my affection for you and the Goddesses.
ChatGift_Dislike[Dislike][P] |= By the grace of the Goddesses, is this some kind of jest? Do you find pleasure in testing my patience?
ChatGift_Dislike[Neutral][P] |= I must confess, I expected more.
ChatGift_Dislike[Friendly][P] |= Your intentions may be pure, but this gift misses the mark. I had hoped our camaraderie would have guided you in selecting something more suitable.
ChatGift_Dislike[Like][P] |= It pains me to see such a lack of understanding between us. I had believed you knew me better than anyone.
ChatGift_Dislike[Love][P] |= How could you, of all people? I expected our friendship to have transcended such oversights by now.
ChatGift_Dislike[Love][P] |= How could you, of all people? I expected our relationship to have transcended such oversights. 
ChatGift_Fruit[Dislike][J] |= Oh, great... more fresh stuff. I suppose I'll find a way to choke it down. Thanks.
ChatGift_Favourite[Dislike][P] |= A thoughtful offering, despite the gulf between us in the eyes of the Goddess.
ChatGift_Favourite[Neutral][P] |= Your gift has kindled a spark of warmth, a nod from the Goddess, perhaps.
ChatGift_Favourite[Friendly][P] |= A cherished offering from a cherished friend, may the Goddesses bless you.
ChatGift_Favourite[Like][P] |= May the Goddesses smile upon you, for this gift reflects the beauty of our friendship.
ChatGift_Favourite[Love][P] |= In your gift, I see not only your kindness but also the hand of the Goddesses at play.

ChatGift_Fruit[Neutral][J] |= You brought me a delightful piece of nature's candy.
ChatGift_Fruit[Friendly][J] |= Oh, how thoughtful. These will make a delicious snack.
ChatGift_Fruit[Like][J] |= You always know how to put a smile on my face. These are perfect.
ChatGift_Fruit[Love][J] |= I can't believe you found this. You're truly the most wonderful person in the world.
ChatGift_Fish[Dislike][J] |= Another fish? Ugh, the smell is unbearable.
ChatGift_Fish[Neutral][J] |= Well, well, what do we have here? A slippery fish. I'll whip up a tasty treat in no time.
ChatGift_Fish[Friendly][J] |= Wow, this is an impressive catch.
ChatGift_Fish[Like][J] |= You always manage to hook me with your kindness. Thanks for this incredible fish.
ChatGift_Fish[Love][J] |= You've stolen my heart once again with this beautiful fish. I'm forever grateful for your thoughtfulness.
ChatGift_Herb[Dislike][J] |= Do you have any idea how many herbs I already have?
ChatGift_Herb[Neutral][J] |= Oh, the aroma of this herb is simply divine. My culinary creations will reach new heights.
ChatGift_Herb[Friendly][J] |= Hey, thanks for the herb. I can't wait to incorporate it into my cooking.
ChatGift_Herb[Like][J] |= I'm absolutely delighted. This herb is so aromatic.
ChatGift_Herb[Love][J] |= You've outdone yourself once again. This herb is exactly what I needed for dinner tonight.
ChatGift_Meal[Dislike][J] |= A meal, huh? I hope you didn't burn it.
ChatGift_Meal[Neutral][J] |= This meal is a work of art. It's good that I have an appetite as big as my laugh.
ChatGift_Meal[Friendly][J] |= Whoa, you brought me a whole meal. You really know how to satisfy a hungry friend.
ChatGift_Meal[Like][J] |= This meal looks incredibly delicious. You've outdone yourself.
ChatGift_Meal[Love][J] |= Oh my goodness. This meal is an absolute feast. You went above and beyond to make me happy.
ChatGift_MiscFood[Dislike][J] |= Ah, a scrumptious morsel of food.
ChatGift_MiscFood[Neutral][J] |= Oh, this snack is just what I needed. 
ChatGift_MiscFood[Friendly][J] |= Hey, look at this tasty treat. You really know how to make a friend's belly happy.
ChatGift_MiscFood[Like][J] |= This food looks absolutely mouthwatering. You've got impeccable taste.
ChatGift_MiscFood[Love][J] |= This food is like a dream come true. You know me so well.
ChatGift_Seeds[Dislike][J] |= More seeds? Well, I'll toss them in the dirt and watch them grow.
ChatGift_Seeds[Neutral][J] |= Ah, seeds. The potential they hold is simply awe-inspiring. I'll nurture them with care.
ChatGift_Seeds[Friendly][J] |= Planting the seeds of friendship, are we? I'll make sure they blossom into something beautiful.

ChatGift_Seeds[Love][J] |= With your gift, my garden will be a paradise. You're the kindest person I know.
ChatGift_Flower[Dislike][J] |= A flower? You shouldn't have. Now I have to find a vase.
ChatGift_Flower[Neutral][J] |= These flowers will brighten up any room. Thanks for bringing me a touch of sunshine.
ChatGift_Flower[Friendly][J] |= Oh, how lovely. These flowers will make my day bloom with joy.
ChatGift_Flower[Like][J] |= You've plucked petals of happiness and delivered them straight to my heart. These flowers are delightful. 
ChatGift_Flower[Love][J] |= This flower is an absolute masterpiece. Someone should paint it.
ChatGift_Gift[Dislike][J] |= I'm rarely impressed. Thanks anyway.
ChatGift_Gift[Neutral][J] |= What's this? A gift? You shouldn't have.
ChatGift_Gift[Friendly][J] |= A surprise present? You've really caught me off guard, and I love it.
ChatGift_Gift[Like][J] |= You got me a gift? You really know how to make me feel special.
ChatGift_Gift[Love][J] |= Your thoughtfulness knows no bounds.
ChatGift_MiscItem[Dislike][J] |= What am I supposed to do with this? Thanks, I guess...
ChatGift_MiscItem[Neutral][J] |= This might come in handy.
ChatGift_MiscItem[Friendly][J] |= Hey, look at this. A useful game item. You're always thinking of others.
ChatGift_MiscItem[Like][J] |= This is fantastic. Thanks.
ChatGift_MiscItem[Love][J] |= You have a magical ability to bring me exactly what I need.
ChatGift_MonsterPart[Dislike][J] |= Eww, what's this? Is it part of some disgusting creature? It stinks!
ChatGift_MonsterPart[Neutral][J] |= Whoa, a piece of a fearsome creature. A smelly fearsome creature, no less.
ChatGift_MonsterPart[Friendly][J] |= Monsters don't stand a chance against you.
ChatGift_MonsterPart[Like][J] |= You're truly an adventurer extraordinaire.
ChatGift_MonsterPart[Love][J] |= This monster part is absolutely extraordinary. Just like the monster, I'm in bits.
ChatGift_Tool[Dislike][J] |= A tool, huh? I'm sure it will have its uses.
ChatGift_Tool[Neutral][J] |= Ah, a trusty tool. With this in hand, I'll conquer any challenge that comes my way. That needs a tool.
ChatGift_Tool[Friendly][J] |= You always come through with the perfect gear.
ChatGift_Tool[Like][J] |= This tool is absolutely fantastic. Did you craft it?
ChatGift_Tool[Love][J] |= This tool is an absolute game-changer.
ChatGift_Sword[Dislike][J] |= Thanks, I guess. I'll add it to my collection.
ChatGift_Sword[Neutral][J] |= You've given me the strength to face any foe.
ChatGift_Sword[Friendly][J] |= Check out this mighty sword.
ChatGift_Sword[Like][J] |= Thanks. I'll vanquish evil with it in your honour.
ChatGift_Sword[Love][J] |= Its gleaming blade represents the unwavering strength of our friendship. I'm forever grateful.
ChatGift_Dislike[Dislike][J] |= Oh, fantastic. Another precious item I dislike. Did I do something to deserve this?
ChatGift_Dislike[Neutral][J] |= Huh, so you didn't bother to learn what I actually like. Thanks for the effort, I suppose.
ChatGift_Dislike[Friendly][J] |= I'm going to take this as a friendly reminder that you don't quite get my taste. 
ChatGift_Dislike[Like][J] |= I must say, I expected more from you. But hey, we all have our off days. 
ChatGift_Dislike[Love][J] |= I thought you knew me better than anyone. This is one of my disliked items...
ChatGift_Favourite[Dislike][J] |= You've got an eye for this stuff, I'll give you that.
ChatGift_Favourite[Neutral][J] |= You just made my day. Thanks a million.
ChatGift_Favourite[Friendly][J] |= You always bring a smile to my face, especially with gifts like this.
ChatGift_Favourite[Like][J] |= Haha, you're too kind. I've got a soft spot for you, you know that?
ChatGift_Favourite[Love][J] |= You're amazing! You nailed it!

ChatGift_Fruit[Dislike][B] |= Hmph. Is that all you could scrounge up? I've seen better produce in a compost heap.
ChatGift_Fruit[Neutral][B] |= Not bad, but I've seen better.
ChatGift_Fruit[Friendly][B] |= Ah, a delightful piece of nature's bounty. You're getting the hang of it, my friend. But remember, I'm still the master of flavour.
ChatGift_Fruit[Like][B] |= Crisp and succulent. You're learning from the best.
ChatGift_Fruit[Love][B] |= You've brought a fine gift of fresh goods. It's as if you understand the essence of my brilliance.
ChatGift_Fish[Dislike][B] |= Ugh, more slimy fish. I suppose I can work my culinary magic and salvage it somehow.
ChatGift_Fish[Neutral][B] |= Not too shabby, but you can do better. Let's reel in something more impressive next time?
ChatGift_Fish[Friendly][B] |= You've hooked a fine fish, my friend. Almost as good as one of mine.
ChatGift_Fish[Like][B] |= Now that's a catch. A magnificent fish, indeed. Your angling skills are improving.
ChatGift_Fish[Love][B] |= Oh, marvellous. A splendid fish, gracefully presented.
ChatGift_Herb[Dislike][B] |= Thanks for the herb, but let's be clear: it's barely a step above worthless in my book.
ChatGift_Herb[Neutral][B] |= Not bad, not bad. But remember, we need a whole book of flavours, not just a single leaf.
ChatGift_Herb[Friendly][B] |= A herb, full of fragrance and potential. We're one step closer to culinary perfection.
ChatGift_Herb[Like][B] |= A fine herb indeed. You're starting to appreciate the secrets of nature. With a little guidance from me, you might become a herbologist extraordinaire.
ChatGift_Herb[Love][B] |= Herbs. Oh, my heart sings with joy at your delightful choice. I shall transmute these ordinary ingredients into a masterpiece.
ChatGift_Meal[Dislike][B] |= A meal? How thoughtful of you to rob me of my culinary expertise. I'll just pretend to be impressed.
ChatGift_Meal[Neutral][B] |= Hmm, a meal ready to be devoured. It's decent, I suppose.
ChatGift_Meal[Friendly][B] |= You brought me a meal? You're a lifesaver. Let's see how I can make it even tastier.
ChatGift_Meal[Like][B] |= Now that's a meal I can appreciate. Your culinary skills are blossoming.
ChatGift_Meal[Love][B] |= Oh, a meal made especially for me? You spoil me, my dear friend. I'll enhance it with my culinary expertise and create a dish fit for the Goddesses.
ChatGift_MiscFood[Dislike][B] |= Thanks for the food, I suppose. It's not like I couldn't get better myself, though.
ChatGift_MiscFood[Neutral][B] |= Thanks for the food. I'll find a way to make it more interesting.
ChatGift_MiscFood[Friendly][B] |= Mmm, delicious food. You're on the right track. But don't forget, I'm still the best cook since sliced onions.
ChatGift_MiscFood[Like][B] |= Ah, food. You always know how to satisfy my cravings. I'll turn this into a feast fit for the dogs. Or should that be gods?
ChatGift_MiscFood[Love][B] |= Food, glorious food.
ChatGift_Seeds[Dislike][B] |= Basic, but at least you're trying to plant something between us. You might learn a thing or two from observing my expert gardening skills.
ChatGift_Seeds[Neutral][B] |= How thoughtful of you. I'll take them and make something impressive out of them. Just watch and learn.
ChatGift_Seeds[Friendly][B] |= Oh, you brought me some seeds. That's fantastic. Just wait until you see what I can do with them. Prepare to be blown away.
ChatGift_Seeds[Like][B] |= Seeds are the perfect gift for a horticultural genius like me. Get ready for a garden that will make people talk, and all thanks to you.
ChatGift_Seeds[Love][B] |= Seeds are like poetry to me, and you're an inspiration behind it all. With your gift in my hands, I'll create a garden that will whisper our friendship to every passerby.
ChatGift_Flower[Dislike][B] |= A bouquet, huh? It's no masterpiece, but it shows a flicker of taste.
ChatGift_Flower[Neutral][B] |= Well, well, well. It seems you have a bit of taste, after all. But let's be honest, my knack for floral arrangements is on a whole different level!
ChatGift_Flower[Friendly][B] |= How sweet of you. But let's be honest, my friend, when it comes to tending to the flora, I'm in a league of my own. Still, your effort is commendable.
ChatGift_Flower[Like][B] |= Flowers? For me? You're too kind. I absolutely love them, but let's be honest, my expertise in the garden is second to none.
ChatGift_Flower[Love][B] |= These flowers are divine. Your taste aligns perfectly with mine.
ChatGift_Gift[Dislike][B] |= Oh, you got me something? Of course, I could have easily obtained it myself, but I'll let you have this small victory.
ChatGift_Gift[Neutral][B] |= What do we have here? A gift for me? It's a decent choice, I suppose.
ChatGift_Gift[Friendly][B] |= Wow, a gift? You shouldn't have. But since you did, I must say it's a pretty good one.
ChatGift_Gift[Like][B] |= You brought me a gift? That's fantastic. I'm genuinely impressed.
ChatGift_Gift[Love][B] |= A gift for me? Oh, how lovely. You truly understand me. But no matter what you give me, it can never match the affection and admiration I have for you.
ChatGift_MiscItem[Dislike][B] |= Nothing special, but at least you're making an effort. 
ChatGift_MiscItem[Neutral][B] |= Not bad, I suppose. But let me tell you, I've seen countless items in my adventures that would put this one to shame. It's kinda cute, though.
ChatGift_MiscItem[Friendly][B] |= It's quite lovely, really. Of course, I have a few even more remarkable pieces in my collection, but this one is special because it's from you.
ChatGift_MiscItem[Like][B] |= Look at what you've given me. It's a good thing I have such a discerning eye to appreciate its beauty.
ChatGift_MiscItem[Love][B] |= You've captured my heart once again with this extraordinary gift. It may not possess the same brilliance as me, but it symbolises the strength of our connection.
ChatGift_MonsterPart[Dislike][B] |= Oh, a monster part? Well, I suppose it's decent.
ChatGift_MonsterPart[Neutral][B] |= Thanks for the monster part. I'll make sure to put it to good use.
ChatGift_MonsterPart[Friendly][B] |= Ah, a piece of a defeated monster. Not bad, not bad. You're starting to grasp the thrill of the hunt.
ChatGift_MonsterPart[Like][B] |= Let me put my talent to work and create something extraordinary out of it. I can't wait to see the look on your face when you witness my sheer awesomeness.
ChatGift_MonsterPart[Love][B] |= This monster part is exquisite, just like you. You smell nicer, though.
ChatGift_Tool[Dislike][B] |= A tool from you? I suppose it's better than nothing, but I could have made it twice as good with half the effort.
ChatGift_Tool[Neutral][B] |= A tool, huh? Well, I appreciate the thought. I'll give it a shot and see if it can live up to my standards.
ChatGift_Tool[Friendly][B] |= That's awesome. I'm excited to give it a try and see how it enhances my abilities.
ChatGift_Tool[Like][B] |= This tool will undoubtedly elevate my abilities, and I'll make sure everyone knows it's thanks to you.
ChatGift_Tool[Love][B] |= You've given me a tool that perfectly complements my abilities, and it symbolizes our friendship. 
ChatGift_Sword[Dislike][B] |= A sword, huh? I've seen better. But I suppose it'll do, considering your limited capabilities.
ChatGift_Sword[Neutral][B] |= Interesting choice, a sword. I can appreciate the craftsmanship, but you'll soon realize that true skill comes from within.
ChatGift_Sword[Friendly][B] |= Oh, wow. A sword? That's fantastic. Thanks. I'll have to show you some of my moves with this beauty.
ChatGift_Sword[Like][B] |= You've truly outdone yourself. A sword. With this in my hands, there's nothing I can't conquer.
ChatGift_Sword[Love][B] |= With this blade in my hands, I'll etch our names in the annals of legend. Thank you, my dear.
ChatGift_Dislike[Dislike][B] |= Ah, another pitiful attempt to irritate me, I see. Bravo. You've succeeded in your mission to annoy, if nothing else.
ChatGift_Dislike[Neutral][B] |= Hmmm, so you still haven't grasped my preferences, have you? It's astonishing how oblivious you can be. But I suppose that's expected.
ChatGift_Dislike[Friendly][B] |= Well, bless your heart for attempting to test the limits of my patience.
ChatGift_Dislike[Like][B] |= To think that you, of all people, would gift me something so utterly repulsive. I had such faith in you.
ChatGift_Dislike[Love][B] |= I thought our friendship was built on understanding, but it seems I was wrong.
ChatGift_Favourite[Dislike][B] |= Well, you've finally done something marginally impressive.
ChatGift_Favourite[Neutral][B] |= You've got potential. Keep trying to impress me.
ChatGift_Favourite[Friendly][B] |= I can see you've been taking notes on my impeccable taste. Well done.
ChatGift_Favourite[Like][B] |= You clearly know what's good, and you're learning from the best.
ChatGift_Favourite[Love][B] |= I can't help but love this gift.

ChatGift_Fruit[Dislike][Q] |= Oh, great... more green stuff. I suppose I can't complain. It's better than the taste of disappointment.
ChatGift_Fruit[Neutral][Q] |= Ah, the joys of fruits and veggies. They're like little nuggets of mundane surprises.
ChatGift_Fruit[Friendly][Q] |= You've brought me a delightful piece of produce. It's like a tiny rainbow of deliciousness. Thank you for adding colour to my day.
ChatGift_Fruit[Like][Q] |= Oh, how I adore you. And your impeccable taste in fruits and veggies.
ChatGift_Fruit[Love][Q] |= It's like a kiss from the garden of our friendship, blooming with delight.
ChatGift_Fish[Dislike][Q] |= What a catch. And by that, I mean the smell alone is enough to make me want to hurl.
ChatGift_Fish[Neutral][Q] |= Ah, the fragrance of fish fills the air. It's like a perfume I never asked for. Thanks.
ChatGift_Fish[Friendly][Q] |= You've reeled in a remarkable fish. Its scales glisten like tiny gemstones.
ChatGift_Fish[Like][Q] |= You've reeled in my heart, once again. A fish, a gift of love and admiration.
ChatGift_Fish[Love][Q] |= This fish you've gifted me is like a shimmering jewel from the stream.
ChatGift_Herb[Dislike][Q] |= A herb. It's like chewing on grass, except less appetising and twice as disappointing.
ChatGift_Herb[Neutral][Q] |= Ah, the delicate scent of the herb tickles my nostrils.
ChatGift_Herb[Friendly][Q] |= Its fragrant whispers hold the promise of culinary enchantment. Let's sprinkle some magic into our dishes.
ChatGift_Herb[Like][Q] |= You've gifted me with an herb so perfect it makes my heart blossom with joy. It's like a sprinkle of enchantment in my hands.
ChatGift_Herb[Love][Q] |= You have a knack for enchanting my senses, my cherished friend. This herb is a fragrant reminder of our shared passion for culinary wonders.
ChatGift_Meal[Dislike][Q] |= It's like someone tried to cook happiness and failed miserably. But hey, at least it's edible.
ChatGift_Meal[Neutral][Q] |= It's not exactly a banquet fit for Fae, but I'll gobble it down.
ChatGift_Meal[Friendly][Q] |= You've brought me a mouthwatering meal, my friend. It's like a symphony of flavours.
ChatGift_Meal[Like][Q] |= You've orchestrated a feast fit for royalty. A testament to your impeccable taste.
ChatGift_Meal[Love][Q] |= Every bite of this meal is a moment of bliss, my cherished friend. It's as if you've infused each ingredient with the essence of our extraordinary bond!
ChatGift_MiscFood[Dislike][Q] |= Ah, food, The elixir of life, they say. Too bad this particular elixir tastes like lukewarm regret.
ChatGift_MiscFood[Neutral][Q] |= Ah, food. The eternal companion of hunger. It won't win any awards, but it's sustenance nonetheless.
ChatGift_MiscFood[Friendly][Q] |= You've brought me food, my cherished friend. It's like a taste of home wrapped in a delicious embrace.
ChatGift_MiscFood[Like][Q] |= It's like a delicious melody that resonates with the deepest chambers of my heart. With every bite, I taste the sweetness of our connection.
ChatGift_MiscFood[Love][Q] |= You have a magical way of touching my heart through food, my cherished chum.
ChatGift_Seeds[Dislike][Q] |= Seeds? How utterly unexciting. It's like receiving a gift wrapped in a yawn.
ChatGift_Seeds[Neutral][Q] |= You know, seeds are nature's way of sharing its secrets with us. With each one, a new story unfolds.
ChatGift_Seeds[Friendly][Q] |= Seeds, my friend. They hold the power to transform mere soil into a flourishing tapestry of colours and fragrances.
ChatGift_Seeds[Like][Q] |= Oh, my extraordinary friend. Seeds. They're like tiny fragments of magic, just waiting to sprout into wonders beyond our wildest dreams.
ChatGift_Seeds[Love][Q] |= Seeds. They hold the key to a universe of possibilities. Let's plant them together.
ChatGift_Flower[Dislike][Q] |= More flowers. They wither, just like my patience for your attempts at pleasing me.
ChatGift_Flower[Neutral][Q] |= With these flowers, you've added a touch of nature's poetry to my world.
ChatGift_Flower[Friendly][Q] |= Oh, my blossoming friend. Flowers. They're like little ambassadors of joy.
ChatGift_Flower[Like][Q] |= Ah, the gift of flowers. They dance in the breeze, whispering tales of friendship.
ChatGift_Flower[Love][Q] |= You've brought me flowers, my dear. They're like a tapestry woven with the threads of our joy.
ChatGift_Gift[Dislike][Q] |= A gift? Spare me the charade. I suppose you want a standing ovation for your mediocre attempt at pleasing me.
ChatGift_Gift[Neutral][Q] |= A gift, my friend. It's like a tiny mystery waiting to be unravelled.
ChatGift_Gift[Friendly][Q] |= A gift. How marvellous. It's like a tangible embrace filled with the magic of our friendship.
ChatGift_Gift[Like][Q] |= A gift from your hands fills me with boundless joy.
ChatGift_Gift[Love][Q] |= You've gifted me with a piece of your heart, my dear. This gift symbolizes the affection we have for each other.
ChatGift_MiscItem[Dislike][Q] |= Another useless trinket from you. Just what I needed to clutter up my already chaotic existence.
ChatGift_MiscItem[Neutral][Q] |= Ah, another addition to my vast collection of odds and ends.
ChatGift_MiscItem[Friendly][Q] |= Oh my goodness, look at this delightful little thing you found for me. You always know how to brighten my day.
ChatGift_MiscItem[Like][Q] |= Oh my gosh, you brought me something? You have no idea how much that means to me. I can't contain my excitement. Let's celebrate with a dance.
ChatGift_MiscItem[Love][Q] |= No way. You found this just for me? You're amazing. I'm absolutely thrilled. This is going straight into my hall of treasures. You're becoming my favourite person ever!
ChatGift_MonsterPart[Dislike][Q] |= Oh, wonderful. Another memento from the realm of nightmares. It's like you're determined to haunt my dreams. And stink the house out, too.
ChatGift_MonsterPart[Neutral][Q] |= Ah, a part of a monster. It's a testament to the awe-inspiring diversity of the creatures that roam our realms.
ChatGift_MonsterPart[Friendly][Q] |= A part of a monster. It's like a thrilling relic from the realms of myth and legend. Or a bit of one, at least. 
ChatGift_MonsterPart[Like][Q] |= Oh, you extraordinary champion. A part of a monster, a token from the realm of dreams, but more probably those woods you can go fight in.
ChatGift_MonsterPart[Love][Q] |= You've granted me a piece of the fantastical, my fearless ally. This monster part is a stinky and revolting reminder of you.
ChatGift_Tool[Dislike][Q] |= Just what I always wanted. A dusty reminder of someone's unimpressive gift-giving skills.
ChatGift_Tool[Neutral][Q] |= You've brought me a tool. It's like a key that unlocks the doors of possibility and empowers us to craft our own destinies. Or is it just a tool?
ChatGift_Tool[Friendly][Q] |=  A tool. It's like a magical instrument that empowers us to shape the world around us.
ChatGift_Tool[Like][Q] |= Oh, my ingenious muse. A tool from your hands fills me with inspiration.
ChatGift_Tool[Love][Q] |= With this tool, you've gifted me a brush to paint the canvas of our dreams, my visionary companion. Let's bring our imaginations to life!
ChatGift_Sword[Dislike][Q] |= How utterly cliché. I suppose it's marginally more useful against a Hob than a toothpick.
ChatGift_Sword[Neutral][Q] |= With this sword, you've added a bit of security to my world.
ChatGift_Sword[Friendly][Q] |= A sword. It's like a gleaming beacon of courage, a testament to the battles we face and the triumphs we celebrate.
ChatGift_Sword[Like][Q] |= It's as if you've recognised the warrior's heart that beats within me and gifted me with a weapon that amplifies our bond.
ChatGift_Sword[Love][Q] |= You've brought me a sword that shines with the brilliance of our shared courage, my champion. Its presence inspires me to greatness.
ChatGift_Dislike[Dislike][Q] |= Well, isn't this just my lucky day? Getting stuck with something I despise.
ChatGift_Dislike[Neutral][Q] |= It's truly astonishing how villagers stumble upon things that I couldn't care less about. 
ChatGift_Dislike[Friendly][Q] |= I must admit, I never thought you'd be capable of such a disappointment. But fear not, I shall forgive you - eventually.
ChatGift_Dislike[Like][Q] |= I thought you knew me better than anyone, and yet, you present me with this monstrosity.
ChatGift_Dislike[Love][Q] |= What a ghastly offering. It's as if a thousand dreams have been shattered in an instant.
ChatGift_Favourite[Dislike][Q] |= Color me surprised. I'll put this where I put my secret stash.
ChatGift_Favourite[Neutral][Q] |= You, my friend, have a talent for surprises. I'm officially intrigued.
ChatGift_Favourite[Friendly][Q] |= I've got more warm fuzzies than a hedgehog in a sweater.
ChatGift_Favourite[Like][Q] |= You're like a walking good-vibes generator. This gift? Top-notch.
ChatGift_Favourite[Love][Q] |= You, my dear friend, are a rare species of fantastic. I'm loving both you and this gift, right now.

ChatGift_Fruit[Dislike][C] |= You know, giving me this produce won't magically fix everything. But hey, thanks, I guess.
ChatGift_Fruit[Neutral][C] |= Ah, more healthy stuff. It was just what I needed to remind me of how boring life can be. Thanks!
ChatGift_Fruit[Friendly][C] |= Oh, look, a healthy surprise. Thanks for considering my well-being.
ChatGift_Fruit[Like][C] |= Healthy food may not be my first choice, but I appreciate the thought.
ChatGift_Fruit[Love][C] |= How delightful. I shall savour every bite and grumble ever so lovingly.
ChatGift_Fish[Dislike][C] |= Oh, great... fish. Just what I always wanted. You know I'm not a cat, right?
ChatGift_Fish[Neutral][C] |= Hmm, fish. Not exactly a thrilling gift, but I appreciate the thought.
ChatGift_Fish[Friendly][C] |= As much as I appreciate the fish. I really don't fancy cooking right now.
ChatGift_Fish[Like][C] |= Oh, fish. You know I can't resist complaining, even when I appreciate your efforts. Thanks, you weirdo.
ChatGift_Fish[Love][C] |= Fish, my friend. You always know how to brighten my day with the perfect gift. I just wish I didn't have to cook it now.
ChatGift_Herb[Dislike][C] |= Oh great, more useless weeds. Just what I needed to brighten my day.
ChatGift_Herb[Neutral][C] |= Herbs, huh? Well, I guess it's better than nothing. Thanks, I guess.
ChatGift_Herb[Friendly][C] |= Hey, you brought me some herbs? Well, I suppose it's a thoughtful gesture, even if I don't really need 'em.
ChatGift_Herb[Like][C] |= Oh, herbs. You're alright, I guess.
ChatGift_Herb[Love][C] |= Herbs. They smell great. Thanks. You are the sunshine in this gloomy world.
ChatGift_Meal[Dislike][C] |= Oh great, another meal. Thanks, I guess.
ChatGift_Meal[Neutral][C] |= Well, I guess I can't complain about free food.
ChatGift_Meal[Friendly][C] |= Hey, thanks for the meal. I'll try not to find too much to gripe about this time.
ChatGift_Meal[Like][C] |= You know, I might actually enjoy this meal. You're not so bad after all.
ChatGift_Meal[Love][C] |= Aw, you shouldn't have. I can already tell this meal is going to be the highlight of my day in Quill. 
ChatGift_MiscFood[Dislike][C] |= Oh great, more food. Thanks, I guess.
ChatGift_MiscFood[Neutral][C] |= Huh, thanks for the food, I guess. Not like it'll solve all my problems.
ChatGift_MiscFood[Friendly][C] |= Hey, you brought me some food? Well, I suppose I can't grumble about that.
ChatGift_MiscFood[Like][C] |= Hey, you really know how to hit the spot. This food might just make up for all the other things that irritate me.
ChatGift_MiscFood[Love][C] |= Oh my goodness. You brought me food? You're an absolute angel. I might actually stop complaining... for a minute.
ChatGift_Seeds[Dislike][C] |= Just what I needed. More things to grow and take care of.
ChatGift_Seeds[Neutral][C] |= Oh, seeds. How... thoughtful. I'll find a place for them, I suppose.
ChatGift_Seeds[Friendly][C] |= Seeds? I'll give them a try. Can't guarantee they won't end up as another gardening disaster, though.
ChatGift_Seeds[Like][C] |= Seeds? Aw, you know me so well. I'll give them a shot, but don't blame me if they turn into a wild mess.
ChatGift_Seeds[Love][C] |= Seeds. This is perfect. I can't wait to plant them and see what beauty they bring to my world.
ChatGift_Flower[Dislike][C] |= Oh great, flowers. Just what I needed to brighten up my day. Thanks a lot.
ChatGift_Flower[Neutral][C] |= Flowers, huh? Well, I guess they're better than nothing. Thanks, I guess.
ChatGift_Flower[Friendly][C] |= Well, look at you, bringing me flowers. Are you trying to make me smile or something? Thanks, I suppose.
ChatGift_Flower[Like][C] |= Hey, you actually got me flowers? That's... surprisingly nice of you. Thanks, I guess. Don't expect me to get all mushy about it.
ChatGift_Flower[Love][C] |= Flowers for me? Wow, you really know how to make a person feel special. I... I appreciate it. Seriously, thanks.
ChatGift_Gift[Dislike][C] |= Great, another thing to add to the pile of disappointments. Just what I needed.
ChatGift_Gift[Neutral][C] |= Oh, a gift? How... nice. Thanks, I guess.
ChatGift_Gift[Friendly][C] |= Well, well, well, aren't you just a ray of sunshine? Thanks for the gift, pal. I appreciate it.
ChatGift_Gift[Like][C] |= Huh, you know what? You're not all bad. Thanks for the gift; it's... decent.
ChatGift_Gift[Love][C] |= Wow, you really outdid yourself this time. This gift is actually pretty great. I guess you're not completely hopeless after all.
ChatGift_MiscItem[Dislike][C] |= Great, just what I needed, another useless trinket to clutter my already miserable existence.
ChatGift_MiscItem[Neutral][C] |= I guess it's something. Not like it'll change the world or anything.
ChatGift_MiscItem[Friendly][C] |= Well, look at that. You actually managed to find something mildly interesting. Thanks, I suppose.
ChatGift_MiscItem[Like][C] |= Hey, not bad. You've got an eye for decent loot. Thanks.
ChatGift_MiscItem[Love][C] |= Wow, you really know how to make my day. This is amazing. I can't believe I get to keep it. You're the best.
ChatGift_MonsterPart[Dislike][C] |= Just what I needed to add to my ever-growing collection. Thanks, I guess. It's not like I have anything better to do.
ChatGift_MonsterPart[Neutral][C] |= Another monster part for me to add to the ever-growing pile.
ChatGift_MonsterPart[Friendly][C] |= You've brought me a monster part? How thoughtful. Now, I get to figure out where to squeeze it into my already cramped storage.
ChatGift_MonsterPart[Like][C] |= You're always surprising me with these monster parts. Who needs personal space when you've got cool stuff, right?
ChatGift_MonsterPart[Love][C] |= You're incredible. Another monster part? You spoil me, seriously. I'll find a special place for it amidst all my treasures.
ChatGift_Tool[Dislike][C] |= Not a lot I can do with this right now. It might come in handy.
ChatGift_Tool[Neutral][C] |= A new tool, huh? Well, I guess it could come in handy.
ChatGift_Tool[Friendly][C] |= Thanks for the tool. I could use all the help I can get around here.
ChatGift_Tool[Like][C] |= Not bad. You actually managed to find something useful for once. Don't let it go to your head, though.
ChatGift_Tool[Love][C] |= Wow, you got me a new tool? You're like my personal lucky charm. I can't believe how helpful it is to have you around.
ChatGift_Sword[Dislike][C] |= Another hunk of metal for me to lug around. Thanks.
ChatGift_Sword[Neutral][C] |= Hmm, a sword. I suppose it might come in handy.
ChatGift_Sword[Friendly][C] |= A sword. Finally, something that might make my adventures a tad less miserable.
ChatGift_Sword[Like][C] |= Hey, a sword. At least it's something useful amidst all this chaos. Thanks.
ChatGift_Sword[Love][C] |= How thoughtful of you. With this, we shall conquer all obstacles and triumph together.
ChatGift_Dislike[Dislike][C] |= Seriously? You think I'd be thrilled about this? Ugh, thanks for nothing.
ChatGift_Dislike[Neutral][C] |= Thanks for the reminder that you are another one of those who have no clue about my tastes.
ChatGift_Dislike[Friendly][C] |= I thought you knew me better than that. Guess I was wrong.
ChatGift_Dislike[Like][C] |= You really don't pay attention, do you? I thought you knew me better than this.
ChatGift_Dislike[Love][C] |= After all we've been through, you still don't know me well enough to get me something I actually want. I'm starting to question if you even pay attention to me at all.
ChatGift_Favourite[Dislike][C] |= Hmph, not bad, I suppose. Still doesn't mean I'll join your little adventures.
ChatGift_Favourite[Neutral][C] |= Wow, you really nailed it this time, didn't you?
ChatGift_Favourite[Friendly][C] |= You know, you're not so bad when you actually listen. I appreciate it. Now, if only you could convince others to do the same...
ChatGift_Favourite[Like][C] |= You're really growing on me with gifts like this. I better not get too attached to you.
ChatGift_Favourite[Love][C] |= You're the best, no doubt about it. You've yet to let me down like most of the others round here.
