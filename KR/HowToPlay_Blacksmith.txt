Name|What Makes a Successful Blacksmith?
Text|Keep a good stock of ready-made items - and be ready to craft any custom order that your customers can think of!

Name|Serving Customers
Text| Customers arrive at the counter when the shop is open and wait for you or a staff member to interact with them.

The coloured meter above a customer's head shows how much patience they have left. They will go if you do not serve them before the meter empties. Customers will not join a queue of more than six people, so keep things moving.

There are two types of Blacksmith customers: Walk-ins and Commissioners.

Walk-in customers want to buy off-the-shelf items for a set purpose. They will describe what they want to do with the item, and then it is up to you to sell them something suitable - someone wanting to chop down weeds in the garden is more likely to want a sickle than a sword.

You gain Brass ☎ and REP <repsymbol> for fulfilling the request: these can be increased by selling a more valuable or better quality item from the appropriate category, e.g. a <item:Tin_Sickle:☆>, <item:Iron_Sickle:☆>, and <item:Iron_Sickle:☉> will all please the customer, but the latter two get you more Brass ☎ and REP <repUp>.

If you have nothing strictly suitable, you can try substituting another type of item. The customer will either accept the item and pay as usual <repUp> or reject it, and you'll lose REP <repDown>. Either way, you get the Brass ☎ for your sold item.

Commissioners want to order a particular item and will give you a few days to create it for them. You can decline a custom order if you don't have the ore or inclination to make it, but this comes with a small REP <repDown> penalty. However, accepting an order and not fulfilling it carries a much higher penalty <repDown>: customers are more disappointed when returning after several days to find that you've let them down.

Commissioners will return after the agreed number of days to say they want to collect their order. The Stock Cupboard will open at Orders: you can only select that customer's item. If the customer's order is not ready, you must cancel <ui_cancel> the transaction.

Name|Crafting Items
Text|You can craft items whether the shop is open or closed. If you are running the shop yourself, you must keep an eye on the counter while crafting. Use the Hang on! button to ask customers to wait a bit longer before walking out.

Use <ui_accept_or_click> the iron ring on the forge to begin crafting. You can use the View Orders button to check for Commissions without returning to the Ledger.

Name|Selecting Moulds and Ore
Text| Select the mould for the item you wish to craft, then select your chosen <link:ore>ore<link>. Re-select either to update your selection.

The Batch Crafting option will appear if you have crafted successfully with the selected mould at least three times. This allows you to produce multiple items at once. Scroll to choose the amount of ore to use - limited by the number in stock or up to 10. Note that the number of items to be crafted might be higher than this; Mr Fairweather's items and shop <link:perks>Perks<link> can be used to help boost the yield.

Name|Smelting
Text|Melt the ore by holding and releasing <ui_accept_or_click> to operate the bellows until the mould is full.
ID|smelt

Name|Heating
Text| Lower the moulded item onto the forge and heat it with <ui_accept_or_click>. Use <ui_accept_or_click> again to stop the triangular marker in the green zone.

You'll get a gold results banner if you get it right, silver if not. Mistakes at this stage mean that later stages will be less forgiving.
ID|heat

Name|Shaping
Text| Hit <ui_accept_or_click> to shape the item when your moving hammer perfectly covers one of the circular targets. Targets get smaller and move faster with the rarest ores.

Hitting the targets perfectly increases the item's durability, which helps to raise its overall Star Rating. Partially hitting a target will slightly increase durability, but missing altogether will lower the item's Star Rating, and missing too many times can even break it, wasting the ore.

Increasing your Strength Stat helps to reduce the difficulty of this phase.
ID|shape

Name|Cooling
Text|Lower the moulded item onto the forge and start cooling it with <ui_accept_or_click>. Use <ui_accept_or_click> again to stop the triangular marker in the green zone.

You'll get a gold results banner if you get it right, silver if not. Breaking the item at this point is still possible, so be careful!
ID|cool


Name|Sharpening
Text|Hold <blacksmith_grind_left> or <blacksmith_grind_right> while a triangular marker is over the green area of the grindstone. You can only sharpen one side of the item at a time! Wait until the green area spins into view again before sharpening the other side.

Sharpening the green target areas will improve the item's durability and Star Rating, whereas sharpening grey areas will damage both.

Name|Results, and where to put them
Text|This screen shows the Star Rating of the item you crafted. Use the Calculation button to find out where you lost or gained points and to view any bonuses from skills or items.

The small number under the item's icon represents the number crafted. This can be boosted by using <link:mould>Batch Crafting<link>, <link:perks>Perks<link>, or items purchased from Mr Fairweather.

You can choose to keep an item for yourself using the Inventory button, send it to the Shelf to be sold to <link:serving>walk-in customers<link>, or to Orders to fulfil a <link:serving>custom order<link>. Note that if you have crafted several items at once, only one will be sent to Orders - the remainder will be placed on the Shelf.

Items can be moved between Inventory, Shelf and Orders in the <link:stock>Stock Cupboard<link>, should you change your mind.

Name|Staff Crafting
Text|Your staff will always prioritise making items for custom Orders up to three days in advance.

When making items to sell off-the-shelf, staff will use the lowest-quality ore and will limit themselves to making three of each type of item.

Crafting staff will not serve customers, but note that the shop is always open while staff are working.

Name|Accounts Page
Text|Blacksmith prices are based upon their Star Rating and the value of the <link:ore>ore<link> used to produce them. Customers will not try to haggle, and you cannot adjust the <link:pricing>prices<link>.

If you give a substitute item to a walk-in customer and it is not accepted, you will still receive the full Brass ☎ price but will suffer a REP loss <repDown>).

Some items may show as losses - negative numbers displayed in red. <link:mwe>Staff wages<link> are always displayed this way, as they cost you Brass ☎. The price of <link:restock>buying stock<link> - either over the counter from customers or via the <link:cupboard>Stock Cupboard<link> - is also subtracted from your daily profits for an item.

<ui_accept_or_click> on the appropriate heading to sort your accounts by the number Sold, the amount of Profit ☎ made, REP <repUp> gained, or by the default, which is in alphabetical order by Item name.

<ui_accept_or_click> on an Item's name to get more detailed information on sales of that particular item. <ui_accept_or_click> again to return to the main Accounts page.

Use the Timescale filter to choose between a big-picture view of your shop's success over time or zero in on daily transactions to see if you are trading at a loss.

Name|Pricing and REP
Text|Quillian blacksmiths have a fixed price structure for off-the-shelf items: customers will pay the going rate based on the rarity of its <link:ore>metal<link> and its Star Rating.

Custom orders bring a significant profit in both Brass ☎ and REP <repUp> but damage your reputation <repDown> if not fulfilled in time. Forcing customers to collect their order when the shop is closed comes with a smaller REP penalty <repDown>.
ID|pricing

Name|Metals and Ores
Text| From least to most valuable: Tin, Zinc, Copper, Iron, Luminium, Shadderwryth, Hyalite. You can offer the more valuable ores for sale as soon as you open the shop, but you won't start getting orders for items made with them until your <link:pricing>Reputation<link> <repUp> grows enough.

Name|Stock Cupboard
Text|This cupboard holds all of the items owned by the shop. It has three sections: Shelf, For Orders, and Materials - all of which can be accessed by you and your staff.

Shelf
Items placed here can be sold to any <link:serving>customer<link> whenever requested.

For Orders
These items are made to fulfil a specific request by a <link:serving>customer<link> and are reserved to be kept until the agreed collection time. Your staff will not sell these items to walk-in customers: you can - but make sure you replace them before the commissioning customer arrives!

Materials
The ore that your staff can use to make off-the-shelf items or custom orders. Staff will always use the lowest-quality ore first.

Managing Stock
Move whole stacks of items - e.g. all <item:Tin_Ore> - between the Cupboard and your Inventory by selecting the item and <ui_alt_or_rightclick>. To select only those of a certain Star Rating, select the item, then select the required Star Rating and <ui_alt_or_rightclick>. Items can be moved singly with <ui_accept_or_click>.

Stock can be <link:restock>ordered<link> from the supplier and will take three days to arrive in the Cupboard. You can speed this up and expand the available range by spending <link:perks>Perk Points<link>. <orderscreen> to access the ordering screen.
ID|cupboard

Name|Restocking with Orders
Text|This page shows all of the items that can currently be ordered from your supplier. It is used to replenish your stocks of ore and off-the-shelf items, NOT to fulfil custom orders.

You will need to spend <link:perks>Perk Points<link> to unlock a broader range of items.

Select <ui_accept_or_click> the Stock heading to order the items by the number you have in stock. Similarly, select the Item heading to return to the default list, which is alphabetically ordered by item name.

Select an item to order more. At first, you can only order a Budget box - this is a set of 10 low-quality items at a low cost. Use Perk Points to unlock the Normal and Premium Box options to order better-quality items at a higher price.

It will usually take three days for items to be delivered once an order is confirmed, so plan ahead! Delivery times can be reduced significantly by spending more perk points.

Name|Hiring Staff
Text|You can hire up to four people to work in your shop. Only people from the shop's Haven will be available - for example, people from Mellowbrook are not happy to walk to the Vale for work every day. Your family can be sent to work in any shop, though.

Use the Hire button in the middle of a Staff Space to see the available workers.

Each potential worker has an <link:mwe>hourly rate<link>. This will be multiplied by the number of hours that you assign them to work (using the <link:rota>Rota<link> page) and will be automatically taken from your Brass ☎ when they leave for the day. Ensure you can cover this cost, as staff will leave and refuse to return if you cannot pay their whole wage!

Employees with a higher hourly rate tend to have <link:stats>Stats<link> that will make them good at working in the shop. However, you can temporarily boost your employees' poorer stats with gifts of food with relevant Traits. You can improve their <link:mwe>Mood<link> this way, too, as well as encouraging them to improve their <link:mwe>Blacksmith Level<link>.

Note that you can have two staff working simultaneously: one on the counter and one crafting items at the forge. Counter and Crafting staff require different <link:stats>stats<link>.

Select a person's name from the list to confirm that you want to hire them. Be aware that people can only be employed in one shop at a time! At this point, you can adjust the employee's <link:mwe>wages<link> - up or down.

Use the Change Pay button to adjust the employee's hourly rate. You can do this at any time.

Your new employee will not start work until you schedule them using the <link:rota>Rota page<link>. Don't forget to do this once you have finished recruiting!

Name|Stats
Text|Stats indicate how well an employee will likely do the job. They can be affected in the short term by gifts and improved over time by boosting the employee's <link:mwe>mood<link>.

Accuracy
Makes Crafting staff more likely to produce high-quality items.

Charm
Counter staff can reduce REP <repDown> lost by giving substitute items to walk-in customers.

Speed
Affects the speed of counter service and time taken when crafting items.

Stamina
Staff member's Energy drops over time while they are working. High Stamina will slow this down.
Staff with low energy become much less efficient and need time at home to recover.

Strength
Makes Crafting staff more likely to produce high-quality items.

Name|Wages, Mood and Experience
Text| Employee's wages are first set when <link:hiring>hiring<link>. Check an employee's wage versus their expected hourly rate by using the Change Pay button on the <link:hiring>Hiring Page<link>. Scroll to raise or lower the wage and Confirm with <ui_accept_or_click>: or use Set Expected to meet the needs of someone you've been underpaying.

An employee's Mood varies according to their wages and working conditions. Mood rises when employees work reasonable hours and are paid above their expected amount per hour; it drops when wages are lower than expected or when the staff member is forced to work too long without enough time at home. It can take several days for someone's mood to change enough to affect their work: the larger the difference between their expected and actual conditions, the faster the Mood change occurs.

Employee's Mood can be checked anytime by looking at their record on the <link:hiring>Hiring Page<link>. A green mask indicates a good mood; yellow, neutral; and red, bad.

A good Mood means an employee will serve customers quickly, and you'll see them making cheerful and polite comments. Unhappy employees are rude and inefficient.

Blacksmith Level indicates an employee's experience working in the shop - it is collected over time. Gaining levels boosts employee <link:stats>Stats<link> while working, improving their efficiency and reducing the need for gifts. Employees will not gain experience if their Mood is bad.

Name|Perk Points
Text|Improving your shop's reputation attracts customers from further afield. At first, customers will only visit shops within their own Haven, but with time, people may arrive from other havens - even other realms!

Perk Points are earned as your REP <repUp> increases. You can use this page to spend them on Perks designed to help you run your shop more efficiently. The Reputation meter on the left page shows your progress towards your next Perk Point. Gain enough REP <repUp>, and the magical Tinker will give you access to even more powerful <link:special>Specialist Perks<link>!

Perk Points are shared among ALL the shops that you own, so, for example, you can use REP <repsymbol> earned in your Blacksmith to help unlock something in your Apothecary.

Spend Perk Points carefully, as there are no refunds!
ID|perks

Name|Specialist Perks
Text|You will be contacted by the mysterious Tinker once your shop reaches the required level of success, based on REP <repsymbol> and Brass ☎ earned. He will sell you access to Specialisations for your shop: Jewellery, Tools and Weapons.

Specialising your shop is about a lot more than just appearance. It will also grant bonuses to acquiring and selling items associated with the specialisation and will grant bonuses to your staff's performance - though there may sometimes be a penalty, too.

Specialist Perks are unlocked with Points in the same way as ordinary <link:perks>Perks<link>. They help you to focus on your chosen specialism, for example, by increasing the number of weapons produced each time you use the forge.

Name|Rota
Text|You must recruit staff using the <link:hiring>Hiring Page<link> before you can set up a rota.

Select <ui_accept_or_click> a staff member's picture, then choose a rectangle on the Rota and <ui_accept_or_click> to assign them to that timeslot. The Left space in each rectangle is for Counter staff: the right, Crafters.

You don't need to have two staff members on each shift: e.g. you can assign someone to the counter and run the forge yourself. Crafting staff will not serve customers, though.

You can drag portraits over multiple rectangles. Select the same squares again to remove the person from that slot.

Note that each square on the rota represents three hours of work, so remember to check what your <link:mwe>wage bill<link> is likely to be!

Staff will get tired if assigned too many hours without a break. This will make them work more slowly, and they may be rude to customers, so give them time to recover energy between shifts or boost their <link:stats>Stamina<link>.
