Dear <PlayerName>

I am passing into nature soon, but do not wish to go without giving my secret Apple Bread recipe to somebody who would appreciate it.

Please accept this and keep making the world a better place.

And make sure you don't burn the bread!

See you again soon as I flutter past your window,

Finn
