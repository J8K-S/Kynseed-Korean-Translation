FNFCONVERSATION_HOUSE_1 |= We're makin' great progress! The fireplace is all cleaned and safe now!
FNFCONVERSATION_HOUSE_1 |= Aye, and I polished up all the brass fixtures. No more tarnish in this lovely home!

FNFCONVERSATION_HOUSE_2 |= By the Goddesses, we're quite the DIY squad!
FNFCONVERSATION_HOUSE_2 |= No kiddin'! Can't wait for 'em to see their shiny, updated home; they'll be on cloud nine!

FNFCONVERSATION_HOUSE_3 |= Pass me a cuppa, will ya? All this work's got me parched.
FNFCONVERSATION_HOUSE_3 |= Cuppa? More like a cup-pa good times!

FNFCONVERSATION_HOUSE_4 |= We're makin' headway! Those wonky doors are now straight as an arrow!
FNFCONVERSATION_HOUSE_4 |= Aye, and I tightened all the loose hinges. No more squeaky-squeaky in this place!

FNFCONVERSATION_HOUSE_5 |= By the Goddesses, we're like a well-oiled machine!
FNFCONVERSATION_HOUSE_5 |= Can't wait to show 'em their good-as-new home; they'll be chuffed!

FNFCONVERSATION_HOUSE_6 |= Hand me that there saw, would ya kindly?
FNFCONVERSATION_HOUSE_6 |= A saw? Saw-weet!

FNFCONVERSATION_HOUSE_7 |= Roof's lookin' better already! How's the paint job coming along, friend?
FNFCONVERSATION_HOUSE_7 |= Smashing! This house'll look as good as new.

FNFCONVERSATION_HOUSE_8 |= Pass me that hammer, will ya?
FNFCONVERSATION_HOUSE_8 |= Hammer? More like 'ammer time!

FNFCONVERSATION_HOUSE_9 |= How's the cleanin' comin' along, buddy?
FNFCONVERSATION_HOUSE_9 |= Slow and steady! This muck's thicker than a swamp.

FNFCONVERSATION_HOUSE_10 |= We're pushing through! The floor's squeaking less, but my knees are feeling the strain!
FNFCONVERSATION_HOUSE_10 |= Aye, and I wrestled with that stubborn door lock. Finally got it workin', though!

FNFCONVERSATION_HOUSE_11 |= Ugh, mates! This blasted house is driving me up the wall, eh?
FNFCONVERSATION_HOUSE_11 |= Tell me about it! My hands are sore from all this work.

FNFCONVERSATION_HOUSE_12 |= Toss me that wrench, will ya?
FNFCONVERSATION_HOUSE_12 |= Wrench? More like wrenching my back!

FNFCONVERSATION_HOUSE_13 |= How's the plaster patchin' comin' along, mate?
FNFCONVERSATION_HOUSE_13 |= Exhausting! I'm covered in dust.

FNFCONVERSATION_HOUSE_14 |= We're slugging away! The floor's less creaky, but my patience is wearin' thin!
FNFCONVERSATION_HOUSE_14 |= Aye, and I battled with that rusty window frame. Finally got it fixed, but what a hassle!

FNFCONVERSATION_HOUSE_15 |= Argh, mates! Fixing up this home is a right pain in the neck, eh?
FNFCONVERSATION_HOUSE_15 |= You can say that again! My muscles are aching all over.

FNFCONVERSATION_HOUSE_16 |= We're slogging through it! The walls are patched, but my arms feel like lead!
FNFCONVERSATION_HOUSE_16 |= Aye, and I wrestled with that overgrown garden. Finally tamed it, but it's been a battle!

FNFCONVERSATION_HOUSE_17 |= Oof, mates! Fixing up this home is harder than I thought, eh?
FNFCONVERSATION_HOUSE_17 |= No kiddin'! My back's achin' something fierce.

FNFCONVERSATION_BRIDGE_1 |= Pass me that rope, will ya?
FNFCONVERSATION_BRIDGE_1 |= Rope? More like hope it doesn't snap!

FNFCONVERSATION_BRIDGE_2 |= How's the plank replacing coming along?
FNFCONVERSATION_BRIDGE_2 |= Slow as molasses! But we'll have it sturdy and safe.

FNFCONVERSATION_BRIDGE_3 |= We're workin' our tails off! Those loose railings are finally tightened up!
FNFCONVERSATION_BRIDGE_3 |= Aye, and I patched up those holes in the walkway. No more trippin' hazards here!

FNFCONVERSATION_BRIDGE_4 |= By the Goddesses, we're a bridge-building brigade!
FNFCONVERSATION_BRIDGE_4 |= You bet! Can't wait for 'em to cross this bridge without worry, they'd better appreciate our hard work!

FNFCONVERSATION_BRIDGE_5 |= Blimey, mates! Repairing this old bridge is taking the wind out of our sails, eh?
FNFCONVERSATION_BRIDGE_5 |= You said it! My hands are cramped from all this work.

FNFCONVERSATION_BRIDGE_6 |= Hand me that hammer, will ya?
FNFCONVERSATION_BRIDGE_6 |= Hammer? More like hammering my patience!

FNFCONVERSATION_BRIDGE_7 |= How's the cable tightening coming along, friend?
FNFCONVERSATION_BRIDGE_7 |= It's a struggle! But we'll have it secure and ready for our wandering friends!

FNFCONVERSATION_BRIDGE_8 |= We're laborin' away! The support posts are finally reinforced!
FNFCONVERSATION_BRIDGE_8 |= Aye, and I filled in those gaps between the planks. No more wobbly steps here!

FNFCONVERSATION_BRIDGE_9 |= By the Goddesses, everyone better be grateful for this steady path we're providing!
FNFCONVERSATION_BRIDGE_9 |= Absolutely! They'd better be ready to sing our praises once they see the sturdy bridge we've crafted for 'em!

FNFCONVERSATION_BRIDGE_10 |= Oof, mates! Fixing this creaky bridge is a proper chore, eh?
FNFCONVERSATION_BRIDGE_10 |= Ain't that the truth! My feet are aching from standing so long. 

FNFCONVERSATION_BRIDGE_11 |= How's the joint repair comin' along, friend?
FNFCONVERSATION_BRIDGE_11 |= Grindin' away! But we'll have it solid as a rock.

FNFCONVERSATION_BRIDGE_12 |= We're working hard on this! The railings are finally straightened out!
FNFCONVERSATION_BRIDGE_12 |= Aye, and I replaced those rotten planks. No more fear of fallingthrough!

FNFCONVERSATION_BRIDGE_13 |= By the Goddesses, we're bridge-mending masters! The locals better acknowledge our hard work!
FNFCONVERSATION_BRIDGE_13 |= For sure! They'd better be ready to celebrate once they see this sturdy bridge we've built!

FNFCONVERSATION_BRIDGE_14 |= Hand me that chisel, will ya?
FNFCONVERSATION_BRIDGE_14 |= Chisel? More like chiselin' away at my sanity!

FNFCONVERSATION_BRIDGE_15 |= How's the bolt tightening coming along, mate?
FNFCONVERSATION_BRIDGE_15 |= Takin' its sweet time! But we'll have it stable and trustworthy.

FNFCONVERSATION_BRIDGE_16 |= We're keeping at it! The underpinnings are finally reinforced!
FNFCONVERSATION_BRIDGE_16 |= Aye, and I filled in those cracks in the stone. No more crumblin' edges here!

FNFCONVERSATION_BRIDGE_17 |= Ugh, this blasted bridge fixing is getting on my last nerve!
FNFCONVERSATION_BRIDGE_17 |= Hey, cheer up! Think about how happy everyone will be when they see their safe new bridge!

FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_START_1 |= This is going to be a long job!
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_START_1 |= Too right! I'm up for the challenge, though.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_START_2 |= This will be satisfying to finish.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_START_2 |= Teamwork will make the dream work.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_START_3 |= Long way to go!
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_START_3 |= But it will be worth it.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_START_4 |= No idea how long this will take!
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_START_4 |= Your guess is as good as mine.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_START_5 |= Let's get cracking!
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_START_5 |= Yes, this might take some work.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_START_6 |= Let me size up this job.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_START_6 |= It looks like a job worth doing.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_START_7 |= Time to get on with the job.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_START_7 |= That's what friends are for!
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_START_8 |= Can you pass me the plan?
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_START_8 |= Here we go.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_START_9 |= It was nice to be asked to help.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_START_9 |= Yes, I didn't realise you knew them so well.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_START_10 |= Tools checked?
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_START_10 |= Yes, we have all we need!
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_START_11 |= Pass me the plan.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_START_11 |= Here we go.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_START_12 |= Looking forward to working with you.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_START_12 |= Likewise!
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_START_13 |= Ready to get going?
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_START_13 |= I was born ready.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_START_14 |= Just checking the resources.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_START_14 |= Looking good to go!
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_MIDDLE_1 |= It's starting to come along nicely.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_MIDDLE_1 |= Yes! I am proud of us all.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_MIDDLE_2 |= I hit my thumb with my hammer.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_MIDDLE_2 |= Ouch! Just don't hit mine.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_MIDDLE_3 |= Can you pass me the saw, please?
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_MIDDLE_3 |= This one?
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_MIDDLE_4 |= Who hid the nails?
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_MIDDLE_4 |= Oh sorry! I was just having a nap on them.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_MIDDLE_5 |= Can't wait for knocking off time!
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_MIDDLE_5 |= Me too! My back is complaining.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_MIDDLE_6 |= This is hard work!
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_MIDDLE_6 |= You need the exercise.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_MIDDLE_7 |= Starting to look good!
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_MIDDLE_7 |= Me? Oh, thanks!
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_MIDDLE_8 |= How much wood have we got left?
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_MIDDLE_8 |= Easily enough. Don't worry.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_MIDDLE_9 |= Knock knock.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_MIDDLE_9 |= Please, not again.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_MIDDLE_10 |= Remind me why I am breaking my back on this.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_MIDDLE_10 |= Friends and family, innit?
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_MIDDLE_11 |= I fancy a nice cup of soup right now.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_MIDDLE_11 |= You drink soup from a cup? Weirdo.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_MIDDLE_12 |= Hold this for me, would you?
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_MIDDLE_12 |= Sure. If you can hold this.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_MIDDLE_13 |= To me.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_MIDDLE_13 |= To you.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_END_1 |= We are so close now I can taste it!
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_END_1 |= That's just sawdust.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_END_2 |= This is looking magnificent.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_END_2 |= Was worth it for our good friend.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_END_3 |= We deserve a pat on the back.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_END_3 |= Not a cow pat, I hope?
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_END_4 |= How much more?
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_END_4 |= Nearly done.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_END_5 |= This build has been quicker than I thought.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_END_5 |= I've done all the work...
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_END_6 |= Hanging around for the unveiling?
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_END_6 |= Will see what time it is.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_END_7 |= Was this bit meant to have been painted?
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_END_7 |= I won't tell if you don't.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_END_8 |= This is been a big job.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_END_8 |= Yeah, but it did need doing!
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_END_9 |= Not long now.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_END_9 |= Not long at all.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_END_10 |= Just a few more tweaks.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_END_10 |= I'm nearly all done over here.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_END_11 |= I was glad to be asked to do this.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_END_11 |= Me too. Good to help out.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_END_12 |= I've enjoyed working with you.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_END_12 |= Yeah, it has been fun. Thanks!
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_END_13 |= Looking good.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_END_13 |= Very solid. For solids.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_END_14 |= This should hold up well.
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_END_14 |= I hope so!
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_END_15 |= Nice job!
FNFCONVERSATION_GENERIC_END_15 |= Thanks! You too.

FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_START_1 |= This is going to be a long job!
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_START_1 |= Too right! I'm up for the challenge, though.
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_START_2 |= This is the first windmill I will have worked on.
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_START_2 |= Hopefully, the last too! Look at the size of this thing.
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_START_3 |= This will be satisfying to finish.
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_START_3 |= Teamwork will make the dream work.
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_START_4 |= Long way to go!
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_START_4 |= But it will be worth it.
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_MIDDLE_1 |= It's starting to come along nicely.
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_MIDDLE_1 |= Yes! I am proud of us all.
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_MIDDLE_2 |= I hit my thumb with my hammer.
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_MIDDLE_2 |= Ouch! Better than hitting your toes!
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_MIDDLE_3 |= Can you pass me the saw, please?
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_MIDDLE_3 |= Sure thing. You'll get a buzz from using it.
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_MIDDLE_4 |= Who hid the nails?
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_MIDDLE_4 |= Oh, sorry! I was just having a nap on them.
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_MIDDLE_5 |= Can't wait for knocking off time!
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_MIDDLE_5 |= Me too! My back is complaining.
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_MIDDLE_6 |= This is hard work!
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_MIDDLE_6 |= You needed the exercise.
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_MIDDLE_7 |= Starting to look good!
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_MIDDLE_7 |= Me? Oh, thanks!
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_MIDDLE_8 |= How much wood have we got left?
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_MIDDLE_8 |= Easily enough. Don't worry.
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_MIDDLE_9 |= Knock knock.
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_MIDDLE_9 |= Please stop.
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_MIDDLE_10 |= We are sailing through this.
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_MIDDLE_10 |= Haha!
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_MIDDLE_11 |= This windmill is a real grind.
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_MIDDLE_11 |= You should be a comedian.
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_MIDDLE_12 |= Remind me why I am breaking my back on this?
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_MIDDLE_12 |= Friends and family, innit?
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_MIDDLE_13 |= I fancy a nice cup of soup right now
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_MIDDLE_13 |= You drink soup from a cup? Weirdo
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_END_1 |= We are so close now I can taste it!
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_END_1 |= That's just sawdust.
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_END_2 |= This windmill is an engineering marvel
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_END_2 |= Can't wait to give it a spin.
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_END_3 |= The grind is nearly over!
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_END_3 |= And a new one will begin!
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_END_4 |= I hope we get free flour for making this.
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_END_4 |= We should onionise.
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_END_5 |= This is looking magnificent.
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_END_5 |= Was worth it for our good friend.
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_END_6 |= Windmill, windmill for the land.
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_END_6 |= Turn forever hand in hand.
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_END_7 |= Nearly done. Just gotta sort those sails.
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_END_7 |= And put a hinge on the door.
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_END_8 |= We deserve a pat on the back.
FNFCONVERSATION_WINDMILL_END_8 |= Not a cow pat, I hope?

FNFCONVERSATION_COWSHED_START_1 |= Let's get this cow shed built.
FNFCONVERSATION_COWSHED_START_1 |= Will make for a happy cow.
FNFCONVERSATION_COWSHED_START_2 |= Ready to build?
FNFCONVERSATION_COWSHED_START_2 |= As ever!
FNFCONVERSATION_COWSHED_MIDDLE_1 |= The cow will love this.
FNFCONVERSATION_COWSHED_MIDDLE_1 |= I fancy moving in myself!
FNFCONVERSATION_COWSHED_MIDDLE_2 |= Hold this plank for me, would you?
FNFCONVERSATION_COWSHED_MIDDLE_2 |= Sure. I have 3 arms, obviously.
FNFCONVERSATION_COWSHED_END_1 |= Just the small details left.
FNFCONVERSATION_COWSHED_END_1 |= They are the most important though.
FNFCONVERSATION_COWSHED_END_2 |= Ready to reveal soon!
FNFCONVERSATION_COWSHED_END_2 |= Yeah! Nice work!

FNFCONVERSATION_STAGE_START_1 |= This is going to be tough.
FNFCONVERSATION_STAGE_START_1 |= Oh, come on! Easy street!
FNFCONVERSATION_STAGE_START_2 |= Resources? 
FNFCONVERSATION_STAGE_START_2 |= Check.
FNFCONVERSATION_STAGE_START_3 |= Let's get that scaffold up.
FNFCONVERSATION_STAGE_START_3 |= Don't want anyone seeing!
FNFCONVERSATION_STAGE_MIDDLE_1 |= The stage is set for magnificence.
FNFCONVERSATION_STAGE_MIDDLE_1 |= I like your confidence.
FNFCONVERSATION_STAGE_MIDDLE_2 |= Hope no monsters destroy this.
FNFCONVERSATION_STAGE_MIDDLE_2 |= We will build it to last.
FNFCONVERSATION_STAGE_MIDDLE_3 |= Need any help over there?
FNFCONVERSATION_STAGE_MIDDLE_3 |= No thanks. Am good.
FNFCONVERSATION_STAGE_MIDDLE_4 |= This will be a centrepiece.
FNFCONVERSATION_STAGE_MIDDLE_4 |= And a masterpiece!
FNFCONVERSATION_STAGE_MIDDLE_5 |= Let's keep working hard.
FNFCONVERSATION_STAGE_MIDDLE_5 |= The things we do for love, eh?
FNFCONVERSATION_STAGE_END_1 |= Time for the big reveal soon!
FNFCONVERSATION_STAGE_END_1 |= This looks amazing!
FNFCONVERSATION_STAGE_END_2 |= What a feat of engineering!
FNFCONVERSATION_STAGE_END_2 |= My feet ache!
FNFCONVERSATION_STAGE_END_3 |= This is worthy of any performance.
FNFCONVERSATION_STAGE_END_3 |= A top-notch repair job.
FNFCONVERSATION_STAGE_END_4 |= I've enjoyed rebuilding this
FNFCONVERSATION_STAGE_END_4 |= Amazing how skilled we all are at carpentry.
FNFCONVERSATION_STAGE_END_5 |= Those drapes need cleaning.
FNFCONVERSATION_STAGE_END_5 |= I'll do them after I finish this bit.

FNFCONVERSATION_JUNK_BLOCKAGE_START_1 |= This should be a cinch.
FNFCONVERSATION_JUNK_BLOCKAGE_START_1 |= It's not really building, is it?
FNFCONVERSATION_JUNK_BLOCKAGE_START_2 |= Should have this cleared in no time.
FNFCONVERSATION_JUNK_BLOCKAGE_START_2 |= What a thing to do.
FNFCONVERSATION_JUNK_BLOCKAGE_MIDDLE_1 |= This stuff is heavy.
FNFCONVERSATION_JUNK_BLOCKAGE_MIDDLE_1 |= Builds your arms up.
FNFCONVERSATION_JUNK_BLOCKAGE_MIDDLE_2 |= What a mess.
FNFCONVERSATION_JUNK_BLOCKAGE_MIDDLE_2 |= Disgraceful dumping.
FNFCONVERSATION_JUNK_BLOCKAGE_END_1 |= Almost there.
FNFCONVERSATION_JUNK_BLOCKAGE_END_1 |= Yeah, thankfully.
FNFCONVERSATION_JUNK_BLOCKAGE_END_2 |= This should ease congestion.
FNFCONVERSATION_JUNK_BLOCKAGE_END_2 |= Not for me. I have hay fever!

FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_START_1 |= Let's get this stall up and running!
FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_START_1 |= Not literally, I hope?
FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_START_2 |= Did you remember the canopy?
FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_START_2 |= Of course! I just left it at home, is all.
FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_START_3 |= Going to enjoy this build.
FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_START_3 |= Me too! Wonder what will be sold here?
FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_START_4 |= This should attract the traders.
FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_START_4 |= Especially if we build it well.
FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_START_5 |= A shame that the original stall was broken.
FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_START_5 |= Indeed, but we can fix it up.
FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_START_6 |= I can't wait to shop here afterwards.
FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_START_6 |= If we build it, they will come.
FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_MIDDLE_1 |= This is a relaxing build.
FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_MIDDLE_1 |= Yeah, I did notice you keep napping.
FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_MIDDLE_2 |= Stop stalling!
FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_MIDDLE_2 |= Isn't that the point of this build?
FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_MIDDLE_3 |= Mark it there, would you?
FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_MIDDLE_3 |= Market where?
FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_MIDDLE_4 |= I'm hungry.
FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_MIDDLE_4 |= I wondered what that growling was.
FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_MIDDLE_5 |= Help me install this, would you?
FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_MIDDLE_5 |= In-stall! Haha!
FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_MIDDLE_6 |= Can you help me with this canvas?
FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_MIDDLE_6 |= I only have two hands!
FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_END_1 |= Just a bit of varnish and dusting, and we are done!
FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_END_1 |= Looking great!
FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_END_2 |= This was a nice build.
FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_END_2 |= Yes, enjoyed making it with you.
FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_END_3 |= I love it when a plan comes together.
FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_END_3 |= We really are the A-team!
FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_END_4 |= Just one more thing...
FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_END_4 |= Is that a reference or an actual status?
FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_END_5 |= Soon, this will be open for business!
FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_END_5 |= I shall be a regular.
FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_END_6 |= We did good work on this.
FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_END_6 |= The instructions helped.
FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_END_7 |= It was good making this with you.
FNFCONVERSATION_MARKET_STALL_END_7 |= And you, even if I did the most.

FNFCONVERSATION_CRYPT_START_1 |= This looks spooky!
FNFCONVERSATION_CRYPT_START_1 |= Hold me! I mean, hold me hammer.
FNFCONVERSATION_CRYPT_START_2 |= Going to be a heavy job, this.
FNFCONVERSATION_CRYPT_START_2 |= That stone looks heavy.
FNFCONVERSATION_CRYPT_START_3 |= Wonder what's inside.
FNFCONVERSATION_CRYPT_START_3 |= Clear it, and we'll find out!
FNFCONVERSATION_CRYPT_MIDDLE_1 |= I still get the creeps.
FNFCONVERSATION_CRYPT_MIDDLE_1 |= That's just me watching you work.
FNFCONVERSATION_CRYPT_MIDDLE_2 |= I'm sweating cobs.
FNFCONVERSATION_CRYPT_MIDDLE_2 |= Corn on the cob?
FNFCONVERSATION_CRYPT_MIDDLE_3 |= This is breaking my back a bit.
FNFCONVERSATION_CRYPT_MIDDLE_3 |= Maybe stop weightlifting those stones?
FNFCONVERSATION_CRYPT_MIDDLE_4 |= This door is sealed tight.
FNFCONVERSATION_CRYPT_MIDDLE_4 |= A bit like your wallet.
FNFCONVERSATION_CRYPT_MIDDLE_5 |= We deserve a nice drink after this.
FNFCONVERSATION_CRYPT_MIDDLE_5 |= And a change of pants.
FNFCONVERSATION_CRYPT_MIDDLE_6 |= Did you hear a noise?
FNFCONVERSATION_CRYPT_MIDDLE_6 |= Sounded like music.
FNFCONVERSATION_CRYPT_MIDDLE_7 |= Wonder what's inside?
FNFCONVERSATION_CRYPT_MIDDLE_7 |= It's a crypt. Take a guess.
FNFCONVERSATION_CRYPT_END_1 |= Just got to open the door, and we are done!
FNFCONVERSATION_CRYPT_END_1 |= You can do that.
FNFCONVERSATION_CRYPT_END_2 |= This door is wedged tighter than my pants.
FNFCONVERSATION_CRYPT_END_2 |= Sounds uncomfortable.
FNFCONVERSATION_CRYPT_END_3 |= Not my favourite job, this.
FNFCONVERSATION_CRYPT_END_3 |= Be good to get it sorted for our friend, though.
FNFCONVERSATION_CRYPT_END_4 |= There better not be ghosts inside!
FNFCONVERSATION_CRYPT_END_4 |= A musical ghost would be the worst!
FNFCONVERSATION_CRYPT_END_5 |= Almost ready for the reveal.
FNFCONVERSATION_CRYPT_END_5 |= I'll get the ribbon.

FNFCONVERSATION_GODDESS_STATUE_START_1 |= Who did this?
FNFCONVERSATION_GODDESS_STATUE_START_1 |= We must fix it up!
FNFCONVERSATION_GODDESS_STATUE_START_2 |= Bless our Goddesses.
FNFCONVERSATION_GODDESS_STATUE_START_2 |= They will appreciate this.
FNFCONVERSATION_GODDESS_STATUE_MIDDLE_1 |= Be careful not to crack any stone.
FNFCONVERSATION_GODDESS_STATUE_MIDDLE_1 |= This job is actually terrifying.
FNFCONVERSATION_GODDESS_STATUE_MIDDLE_2 |= Beautiful carving there.
FNFCONVERSATION_GODDESS_STATUE_MIDDLE_2 |= Thanks! I practice on pork joints.
FNFCONVERSATION_GODDESS_STATUE_MIDDLE_3 |= That engraving is coming along nicely.
FNFCONVERSATION_GODDESS_STATUE_MIDDLE_3 |= Cheers! Takes a steady hand.
FNFCONVERSATION_GODDESS_STATUE_MIDDLE_4 |= We will make them proud.
FNFCONVERSATION_GODDESS_STATUE_MIDDLE_4 |= They deserve quality craftsmanship.
FNFCONVERSATION_GODDESS_STATUE_MIDDLE_5 |= A great idea to fix these.
FNFCONVERSATION_GODDESS_STATUE_MIDDLE_5 |= Handy for the fast traveller too!
FNFCONVERSATION_GODDESS_STATUE_MIDDLE_6 |= No slacking! The Goddesses are watching!
FNFCONVERSATION_GODDESS_STATUE_MIDDLE_6 |= I only dozed off for a moment!
FNFCONVERSATION_GODDESS_STATUE_END_1 |= This is looking wonderful.
FNFCONVERSATION_GODDESS_STATUE_END_1 |= It's just like the original asset.
FNFCONVERSATION_GODDESS_STATUE_END_2 |= I can feel the power within.
FNFCONVERSATION_GODDESS_STATUE_END_2 |= That's just what you ate.
FNFCONVERSATION_GODDESS_STATUE_END_3 |= Lovely work all around.
FNFCONVERSATION_GODDESS_STATUE_END_3 |= We did a fine job.
FNFCONVERSATION_GODDESS_STATUE_END_4 |= How do we get the travel bit to work?
FNFCONVERSATION_GODDESS_STATUE_END_4 |= Turn it off and on again?
FNFCONVERSATION_GODDESS_STATUE_END_5 |= Beautiful!
FNFCONVERSATION_GODDESS_STATUE_END_5 |= Thanks! Oh, the statue, not me.

FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_START_1 |= This is going to be an epic build.
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_START_1 |= Heavy work, for sure.
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_START_2 |= It would help if I liked heights.
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_START_2 |= I am scared of widths!
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_START_3 |= Have we got enough stone for this?
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_START_3 |= Yeah, and plenty of scaffolds.
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_START_4 |= This will be very convenient.
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_START_4 |= About time someone fixed it.
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_START_5 |= This is quite the project!
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_START_5 |= We can do it! Believe!
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_START_6 |= The things we do for love.
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_START_6 |= It's good to build bridges.
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_START_7 |= Heave-ho!
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_START_7 |= I'm trying!
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_START_8 |= Let's get that scaffold up.
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_START_8 |= And don't look down.
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_MIDDLE_1 |= I love the sound of rushing water.
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_MIDDLE_1 |= Soothing when you aren't hanging over it.
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_MIDDLE_2 |= I've lost a stone.
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_MIDDLE_2 |= Diet going well then?
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_MIDDLE_3 |= This water is troubled.
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_MIDDLE_3 |= That's why we need a bridge over it.
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_MIDDLE_4 |= Let's sing a song while we work.
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_MIDDLE_4 |= Let's not.
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_MIDDLE_5 |= Watch that stone.
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_MIDDLE_5 |= Why? What is it doing?
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_MIDDLE_6 |= I need a rest.
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_MIDDLE_6 |= No rest for the wicked!
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_MIDDLE_7 |= Do you think this is strong enough?
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_MIDDLE_7 |= It better be!
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_MIDDLE_8 |= I am enjoying all your company.
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_MIDDLE_8 |= Building our friendship, eh?
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_MIDDLE_9 |= We need some better structure.
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_MIDDLE_9 |= Perhaps a whiteboard or plank?
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_MIDDLE_10 |= This builds character.
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_MIDDLE_10 |= You are a character.
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_END_1 |= Finally! Nearly done!
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_END_1 |= We did a great job together.
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_END_2 |= This should be one great reveal.
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_END_2 |= Need bigger scissors for that ribbon!
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_END_3 |= Soon, we might see animals crossing.
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_END_3 |= That would be fun.
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_END_4 |= We have almost done it.
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_END_4 |= Just the polishing phase.
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_END_5 |= Are we in bug fixing now?
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_END_5 |= Yes. Get the insects off that stone.
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_END_6 |= Fancy a game of bridge?
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_END_6 |= Oh! Snap!
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_END_7 |= This is an amazing structure.
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_END_7 |= We did ourselves proud.
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_END_8 |= It was exhausting but wonderful.
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_END_8 |= You all did a sterling job.
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_END_9 |= Great work! And none of us are engineers.
FNFCONVERSATION_STONE_BRIDGE_END_9 |= Which is why I hope it stays up.

FNFCONVERSATION_GREENHOUSE_START_1 |= Let's get cracking. Not the glass.
FNFCONVERSATION_GREENHOUSE_START_1 |= Yeah, be careful!
FNFCONVERSATION_GREENHOUSE_START_2 |= This is a delicate job, for sure.
FNFCONVERSATION_GREENHOUSE_START_2 |= That's why I brought my thick gloves.
FNFCONVERSATION_GREENHOUSE_START_3 |= Anyone got a measuring stick?
FNFCONVERSATION_GREENHOUSE_START_3 |= How long is a piece of string?
FNFCONVERSATION_GREENHOUSE_START_4 |= This will combine beauty and utility.
FNFCONVERSATION_GREENHOUSE_START_4 |= I thought you said futility then.
FNFCONVERSATION_GREENHOUSE_START_5 |= Make friends to get friends to make.
FNFCONVERSATION_GREENHOUSE_START_5 |= That's the way to do it!
FNFCONVERSATION_GREENHOUSE_MIDDLE_1 |= I need a cup of herbal tea already.
FNFCONVERSATION_GREENHOUSE_MIDDLE_1 |= I don't know how you can drink nettle tea.
FNFCONVERSATION_GREENHOUSE_MIDDLE_2 |= These windows are a pane.
FNFCONVERSATION_GREENHOUSE_MIDDLE_2 |= Smashing joke there.
FNFCONVERSATION_GREENHOUSE_MIDDLE_3 |= We must be careful with this glass.
FNFCONVERSATION_GREENHOUSE_MIDDLE_3 |= You are a stone's throw from smashing it.
FNFCONVERSATION_GREENHOUSE_MIDDLE_4 |= This is growing well.
FNFCONVERSATION_GREENHOUSE_MIDDLE_4 |= Haha!
FNFCONVERSATION_GREENHOUSE_MIDDLE_5 |= I love working with you. Such skill!
FNFCONVERSATION_GREENHOUSE_MIDDLE_5 |= I am a touch of glass, for sure.
FNFCONVERSATION_GREENHOUSE_END_1 |= I needed this structure in my life.
FNFCONVERSATION_GREENHOUSE_END_1 |= May it continue to grow.
FNFCONVERSATION_GREENHOUSE_END_2 |= It does get really hot in here!
FNFCONVERSATION_GREENHOUSE_END_2 |= I know! I am red as a tomato!
FNFCONVERSATION_GREENHOUSE_END_3 |= Just got to clean the glass, and good to go!
FNFCONVERSATION_GREENHOUSE_END_3 |= We did a fine job this day.

FNFCONVERSATION_FAE_GREENHOUSE_START_1 |= Interesting job, this one.
FNFCONVERSATION_FAE_GREENHOUSE_START_1 |= Yes. Strange design!
FNFCONVERSATION_FAE_GREENHOUSE_START_2 |= Shall we get going?
FNFCONVERSATION_FAE_GREENHOUSE_START_2 |= Suppose so. Where to start?
FNFCONVERSATION_FAE_GREENHOUSE_MIDDLE_1 |= This is coming along well.
FNFCONVERSATION_FAE_GREENHOUSE_MIDDLE_1 |= Agreed. Snack break?
FNFCONVERSATION_FAE_GREENHOUSE_MIDDLE_2 |= We are making good time.
FNFCONVERSATION_FAE_GREENHOUSE_MIDDLE_2 |= I have lost all concept of that.
FNFCONVERSATION_FAE_GREENHOUSE_MIDDLE_3 |= How are you doing over there?
FNFCONVERSATION_FAE_GREENHOUSE_MIDDLE_3 |= Not bad, thanks. Getting somewhere.
FNFCONVERSATION_FAE_GREENHOUSE_MIDDLE_4 |= Careful with that glass pane.
FNFCONVERSATION_FAE_GREENHOUSE_MIDDLE_4 |= They are really heavy!
FNFCONVERSATION_FAE_GREENHOUSE_END_1 |= Well, this looks bloody good.
FNFCONVERSATION_FAE_GREENHOUSE_END_1 |= I know! They will love it.
FNFCONVERSATION_FAE_GREENHOUSE_END_2 |= It's an odd construct but beautiful.
FNFCONVERSATION_FAE_GREENHOUSE_END_2 |= Very au Fae, whatever that means.
FNFCONVERSATION_FAE_GREENHOUSE_END_3 |= I need a bath after this.
FNFCONVERSATION_FAE_GREENHOUSE_END_3 |= I need two!
FNFCONVERSATION_FAE_GREENHOUSE_END_4 |= Do you have the ribbon?
FNFCONVERSATION_FAE_GREENHOUSE_END_4 |= I think it's under that thingy.

FNFCONVERSATION_ALTAR_START_1 |= Should be a quick job.
FNFCONVERSATION_ALTAR_START_1 |= Hopefully. I have stuff to do.
FNFCONVERSATION_ALTAR_START_2 |= This will look great.
FNFCONVERSATION_ALTAR_START_2 |= And be very useful!
FNFCONVERSATION_ALTAR_MIDDLE_1 |= Ouch! Dropped a stone on my foot.
FNFCONVERSATION_ALTAR_MIDDLE_1 |= Careful, clumsy.
FNFCONVERSATION_ALTAR_MIDDLE_2 |= My carving skills are improving.
FNFCONVERSATION_ALTAR_MIDDLE_2 |= Yes, I can see that. Nice.
FNFCONVERSATION_ALTAR_MIDDLE_3 |= This will be beautiful.
FNFCONVERSATION_ALTAR_MIDDLE_3 |= Truly worthy of our Goddesses.
FNFCONVERSATION_ALTAR_MIDDLE_4 |= How are you faring?
FNFCONVERSATION_ALTAR_MIDDLE_4 |= Just chiselling this bit.
FNFCONVERSATION_ALTAR_END_1 |= This is looking great!
FNFCONVERSATION_ALTAR_END_1 |= We did a fine job this day.
FNFCONVERSATION_ALTAR_END_2 |= Don't altar anything else. Perfect!
FNFCONVERSATION_ALTAR_END_2 |= Just needs a bit of paint there.
FNFCONVERSATION_ALTAR_END_3 |= Bless this altar.
FNFCONVERSATION_ALTAR_END_3 |= And it will bless us!

FNFCONVERSATION_CHICKEN_COOP_START_1 |= Let's do this!
FNFCONVERSATION_CHICKEN_COOP_START_1 |= Yeah!
FNFCONVERSATION_CHICKEN_COOP_START_2 |= Let's get cracking.
FNFCONVERSATION_CHICKEN_COOP_START_2 |= Was that a pun?
FNFCONVERSATION_CHICKEN_COOP_MIDDLE_1 |= Need more nails.
FNFCONVERSATION_CHICKEN_COOP_MIDDLE_1 |= I just cut mine.
FNFCONVERSATION_CHICKEN_COOP_MIDDLE_2 |= I'm board.
FNFCONVERSATION_CHICKEN_COOP_MIDDLE_2 |= Haha! Love a good pun.
FNFCONVERSATION_CHICKEN_COOP_END_1 |= It's almost ready.
FNFCONVERSATION_CHICKEN_COOP_END_1 |= This looks great!
FNFCONVERSATION_CHICKEN_COOP_END_2 |= Chickens will love this.
FNFCONVERSATION_CHICKEN_COOP_END_2 |= Am not sure they judge aesthetics.

CyrilIntro |= Greetings to you. My name is Cyril, and I am the clerk, secretary, administrator, officiator or whatever you wish to call it, for this humble emergency shelter. Please be respectful of the rules here, which are located in the handbook. You will need form N1-CE-2CU to apply to view the handbook.
CyrilIntro |= Well, what is the shelter, I hear you ask? As duty officer, I shall tell you!
CyrilIntro |= This building used to be the Village Hall, but it has been repurposed to house those displaced by the terrible increase in Hob attacks.
CyrilIntro |= If someone's house is ruined by those wayward monsters, they can stay here until it is repaired.
CyrilIntro |= Thinking of it, you look pretty useful; you should volunteer to help them out and get a working party together to fix their homes up.
CyrilIntro |= Friendly villagers will gladly help you rebuild the smashed wood and shattered windows. Just utilise the signposts in front of the damaged buildings.
CyrilIntro |= We have branches in Candlewych Village, Outlane and Naida's Glory, so feel free to drop in and say hello and see if any unfortunate people need aid.
CyrilIntro |= Goodbye, and please wipe your feet next time.
CyrilIntroRepeat |= Greetings again. I am here and at our other branches until all this Hob and scary monster fuss is over. I was assigned this task by the powers that be. I love it as I spend all day administering forms, organising files, changing sheets and doing my angrywords.
CyrilIntroRepeat |= Angrywords? It's like a very tough crossword... which I am trying to finish if you have no other business.
CyrilIntroRepeat |= Farewell!
CyrilIntroShort |= I can't talk now; I am in the middle of a profound puzzle. Why don't you see if anyone needs help?
