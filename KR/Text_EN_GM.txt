WrightProgress1 |= Well done on taking your first step to becoming a Legend. Take this Torc I forged many moons ago as a token of my appreciation. It will bring you back to the entrance of this hallowed place whenever you use it.
WrightProgress1 |= Now, you might want to check the Noticeboard in your home village of Candlewych. It seems there is trouble brewing in the land, and people may post on the board notices or requests for help. Whatever is going on may be linked to our friend the Jabberwock, or it may be just villagers overreacting. It would help if you investigated either way.
WrightProgress1 |= Our blessings go with you.
WrightProgress2 |= One further step forward in your progress. It is encouraging to see. So, here is another gift for you. This time, it is the Rainstick. I used to sell these by the cartload when I was alive. Very popular with children, High Priests and firemen.
WrightProgress2 |= We have felt a new presence in the world. A dark energy coming from Mellowfields way. It's something to keep an eye on for sure. Hob activity is increasing, and there's talk of foul things afoot.
WrightProgress2 |= I would go and see Master Marshtyt. He is a funny fellow but an excellent gardener. He will be a helpful contact in your quest for legendary status.
WrightProgress2 |= Take heed, and we await until you return with your Urn filled once more.
WrightProgress3 |= Another notch to your renown bow. Slow and steady wins the race.\nTake this Lens as a reward. It will fit nicely into your Obscura and allow you to travel to somewhere very special. Try it at a henge.\nTil we next meet...
WrightProgress4 |= Well met once more. I can tell by your face that you are just here for the prize! Well, here we go. There are places underground you have yet to discover. The miners dug deep, locked the doors, and threw away the keys. Luckily for you, I have a key that unlocks many doors. Now, seek the entrances to the deeper places within the Vale, Summerdown and Mellowfields. I urge caution down there, though!
WrightProgress4 |= Finally, for today, you should speak to an interesting character waiting for you in Wisptrail, over in Woemarsh. We hear that they are having some trouble there. They are a curious group of villagers around Woemarsh, that's for sure. They could need your help.
WrightProgress5 |= Oh-ho! You have returned. Halfway to being a Legend. We are impressed! This next reward is worthy of the hard work you are putting into this noble quest.
WrightProgress5 |= It is a Lens for your Obscura. A new realm of the Fae awaits you at your friendly neighbourhood henge.
WrightProgress5 |= Farewell, once more!
WrightProgress6 |= Oh, here's a sight for ghostly eyes. We will run out of incentives to gift you at this rate. You are becoming so well known! Now, take this. It is a Blizzard Staff. It will cause the most atrocious of snowy conditions. Notice the fine details on the Shadderwryth metal. Such craft.
WrightProgress6 |= Now, you need to be aware that spooky happenings are afoot. You should probably go and look at the Woemarsh Noticeboard and see if there are any leads. I'd not waste your time, so don't forget to do it.
WrightProgress6 |= Fare thee well.
WrightProgress7 |= Edging closer to becoming a true Legend, I see. I have something for you that is unique and tested my skills in intricate crafting. Not everything has to be hewn from hammering huge sheets of metal. This is a musical box made to unlock the power of a mysterious circle of stones over in Mellowfields. Even if you don't try it there, it makes a lovely tune to go to sleep with. I fancy a hot malted drink right now...
WrightProgress8 |= Your Reputation grows fast as lightning. My word it's frightening!\nTo honour your latest achievement, I gift you this aptly named Lightning Rod. Made from the finest copper. This will do the trick whenever you need to whip up a storm, although its power needs to recharge between uses.\nKeep gathering reputation! You are so close now we can taste it! Well, we could if we had actual, real taste buds.
WrightProgress9 |= One more step. Just one. Then we can lay our eyes on the first new Legend since we three Grandmasters were anointed all those years ago.\nTo slay the Jabberwock, you will need to craft the Vorpal Sword, as you should already know. The Mould needed to smith the sword lies to the north of here in another tomb.\nYou will need to fix that bridge first, though. You will notice fixing the bridge requires a particular material. Perhaps our gift can help you source such an item.\nIt is another curious glass lens that can be added to your Obscura lantern. It will open the last henge door and take you somewhere not many have seen! You will reach for the stars!\nSeek the Meteoryt and return a Legend!
WrightProgress10 |= It is incredible, but a Legend now stands before us.\nYou have done as was asked, and your mission is nearly complete. All you are required to do now is gather the ore needed to forge the sword and defeat the Jabberwock. Easy.\nLight is usually required to pierce the darkness. Not this time. Only a weapon of darkness and shadows forged by and wielded by a Legend can destroy the hatred that rampages through the hearts of all Quillians.\nTo that end, you will need Abysstone, the darkest of metals. This Abysstone will have to be used to forge the blade.\nGaining the ore and luring out the beast is not something we can help you with. However, there is one who may have that knowledge - someone you know well.\nGo now. We may call upon you again someday to give you another task, but that is for the future.\nGo. Slay the Jabberwock!
WrightProgress10 |= Oh! Hold it. Before you go, I have one more gift for you before you fulfil your destiny. This Hammer was my own for a long while and served me well. With it, you will add one star to the quality of any item you forge.\nFarewell. Get going... I mean it this time.
WrightTaskComplete |= You are truly the one. You have passed my trial and freed the land of hatred.
WrightTaskComplete |= We see a great future for you. Never before have we felt such a force of nature.
WrightTaskComplete |= We can now sleep, content in our tombs, knowing the land has a guardian.
WrightTaskComplete |= Whatever you choose to do next is up to you. Maybe you have some loose ends you wish to tie up? Perhaps untold wealth is your desire? Perhaps the adoration of everyone in the land?
WrightTaskComplete |= Whatever your desire, we wish you good fortune.
WrightTaskComplete |= Rest well, Legend.
WrightTaskComplete |= Farewell!
WrightPartialProgress |= How goes your progress? Come back when you have reached your next milestone for a reward!
