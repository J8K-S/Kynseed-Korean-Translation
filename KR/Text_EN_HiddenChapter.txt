SiblingReturnFromTomb |= You stood on the stone circle, and the door opened?! A tomb? Grandmasters? A mirror? Jabberwock!
SiblingReturnFromTomb |= I knew there was something evil in that forest. What will you do? Will you really try and become a legend and get that sword to kill it?
SiblingReturnFromTomb |= This is a lot to take in. Why you? We are twins. Surely our blood is the same?
SiblingReturnFromTomb |= It's that damned Fae, isn't it? What did it promise you?
SiblingReturnFromTomb |= Never mind that for now. I need to think. You better start your journey to becoming a legend, I suppose?! I'll do some research at my end and let you know if I discover anything else.
SiblingReturnFromTomb |= Please look after yourself, <PlayerName>, and be careful. And stay away from that rabbit!
SiblingProgress1 |= Good to see you, <PlayerName>. I am glad you are progressing. I decided I needed to push myself too, so I am going to try to master something. I am not sure what I should try to do yet, though. What do you think? Master knitter? Master animal petter? Master of carrots? Maybe I could do that and give some to your rabbit friend. Rabbit, hare, whatever.
SiblingProgress1 |= Anyway, I must get on, and you should too. I am cooking 'Cabbage a-la-cart', and those monsters after you won't slay themselves, you know!
SiblingProgress2 |= Well done! It seems like you are making progress. Me? Oh, I am still working my way towards being a mastermind. Did you know I chose exploration as my specialised subject? I've started now so I'll finish!
SiblingProgress2 |= I do hope you solve that monster problem. Every night when I go to sleep, I can briefly feel a presence, but it goes if I light my candles. So I just leave them on all night now. Don't worry, I am safe here, and I am not going to let a hateful monster scare me away!
SiblingProgress3 |= I have some news for you. I've been to The Circle! You'll know what happened! Yes, it opened! I got inside! I found it very creepy in there. I stood by the pool, and three ghosts appeared and talked to me, just as they did to you.
SiblingProgress3 |= The mirror rose up out of the pool, and I could see myself in there, though I seemed a bit different - taller and stronger almost?
SiblingProgress3 |= They said I was worthy of becoming a Master of Exploration. I couldn't believe it! But then, there was a bright light, and I felt dizzy and like my nerves were burning! But a good burning!
SiblingProgress3 |= To cut a long story short, I am, of course, now a Master! 
SiblingProgress3 |= Thank you! Your kind words mean a lot. So yes, sibling, I will be around for a very long time! 
SiblingProgress3 |= If you want me to teach you any of my knowledge, I am bound to help you, but you must fulfil my requirements. I am happy to teach you Skill anytime.
SiblingProgress3 |= Oh, I feel so powerful now! I must thank you for inspiring me to greater heights!
SiblingProgress4 |= How are things with you? Still growing your reputation, eh? I was over in Copperpot the other day. That's quite a way, you know?
SiblingProgress4 |= Anyway, this merchant over in Copperpot, he claimed he had seen the dreadful Jabberwock. Turned his teeth snow white. Uggghhh.
SiblingProgress4 |= What was I doing in Copperpot? Oh, just noseying around. The people over there are fascinating. Do you know much about them? I really like their hair.
SiblingProgress4 |= Anyhow, the dandelion clock stops for no one; I must carry on my exploring!
SiblingProgress5 |= Oh, hello. Are you faring well? Another notch on your tree or some such thing, eh? Your name is definitely becoming more well-known across Quill.
SiblingProgress5 |= I had a couple of people stop by to learn a skill or two, but what I find noticeable in Quill is a lack of ambition from those who live in the villages. People must get out into the world and learn its wonderful ways! Don't you agree? There's treasure everywhere.
SiblingProgress6 |= Hey! It's you. You are lucky to have caught me at home. I have been trying to learn even more about exploring but being a Master, I have pretty much reached my zenith. I wish I could get further west and that broken bridge to the north annoys me like you wouldn't believe!
SiblingProgress6 |= You should see the things I already found. A flower that sings, a weird ore, a plant I can't even pronounce.
SiblingProgress6 |= I have started visiting the other Masters to learn their ways. It's fascinating. I am levelling up, as the ancient expression says.
SiblingProgress7 |= Ah, my twin! More famous than, er, a very well-known pie or person or whatever.
SiblingProgress7 |= I am addicted to pets. I find lost ones on my travels. They tell me all sorts of things, you know? I walk with the animals, talk with the animals. Grunt and squeak and squawk with the animals. I do a lot!
SiblingProgress7 |= They help me feel safe from that horror in Toughwood. I hope you get to kill it soon. Its hatred pours out of that evil forest, but I have a shield of fluff and a heart that can't be darkened.
SiblingProgress7 |= So get your backside in gear!
SiblingProgress8 |= Hello, you. I've just got back from more exploring. I've seen things you wouldn't believe. Monster's footprints so big you could lie in them.
SiblingProgress8 |= Such things could drive a sane person batty.
SiblingProgress8 |= Have you been anywhere interesting lately? Oh, back into that tomb, eh? Getting close now?
SiblingProgress8 |= Keep going. Never give up! Never surrender! That is the quest.
SiblingProgress9 |= My twin returns! Almost a legend and my own flesh and blood! How far we both have come!
SiblingProgress9 |= The only difference is that I know the true beauty in mastering one skill, whereas you want them all.\nAm just teasing! I am very proud of you.
SiblingProgress9 |= Come back to see me when you have what you need. I've been doing some important work of my own. It can wait for now, but do return. In the meantime, take care.
SiblingFindJabber |= You got the sword! You are indeed an absolute legend! My sibling, raised in a shoe but now armed to the teeth and preparing to kick Jabberwock butt!
SiblingFindJabber |= Do you think you are ready to kill that foul creature?
SiblingFindJabber |= So, you need to know where it hides and seeps its poison? Well, I have you covered. Through my exploring and studies, I know exactly where to find it and how to lure it out.
SiblingFindJabber |= There is a rhyme I discovered on my travels...
SiblingFindJabber |= "In the Toughwood very dark,\nYou will find the hatred heart.\nWear a charm of Hyalite,\nAnd in a storm you'll find your fight.\nThrust the blade of light so deep\nAnd love and hope the land shall keep."
SiblingFindJabber |= Soooo, you need this Hyalite to forge into a charm. It's a good thing you have me, eh? 
SiblingFindJabber |= I took the liberty of using that weird ore I once told you I'd found and getting the Smithy in Copperpot to forge a charm for you. He said it was the hardest metal he had ever worked with. It will cost you a hug. Just kidding. It's yours.
SiblingFindJabber |= Take it and your sword and go free this land of hatred. And you better beat it. I don't want to be crying over your bones, lazybones.
PaigeUnwell |= Glad you made it. These marshes can be pretty hazardous! Now, to the task at hand. 
PaigeUnwell |= We need your help. We're all overwhelmed by negative emotions. A suffocating spirit has entered Woemarsh. It is as though there is something evil in the water. 
PaigeUnwell |= I am convinced from my research that whatever has tainted us is beyond this gate. Please help us. I was told you were the one who could. 
PaigeUnwell |= Take this book of mine. There are clues within. Once you have found what is needed, can you meet me back here?
PaigeEnterDreadwaters |= Ah! So, you actually do have the means to cleanse the Unwell? Then I shall open the gate for you right away.
PaigeEnterDreadwaters |= You are about to enter Dreadwaters. Be warned. There is something in there. Avoid it at all costs. He comes out at night, protecting the area from explorers, but do not let him get you. I speak of Daddy Long Legs. If you can avoid him, you must get inside the tomb to find the well. Look for the mechanisms to open the seals. 
PaigeOutro |= You did it! Already I feel so much better! It's like a huge weight of pure hatred has been lifted. Goddesses bless you. Please take this book as a reward. It tells you more about us folks of Woemarsh. You may find it insightful. Oh, joyous day!
Paige TurnerINTRO |= Now, please forgive us locals if any of us are rude towards you; we can't help it. I hope my theory on why this is happening is correct and that something can be done. P.S., you are ugly.
Mason MakerINTRO |= I'm the finest smithy in Quill, what of it? If you need anything, you better not have candy money.
Gage MakerINTRO |= Tongs of fire! What do you want? Can't you see I have better things to do, like breathe?
Ava GanderINTRO |= Hello. Nice to see a new face as long as you are spending money in our shop. Otherwise, I couldn't care less who you are.
Goose GanderINTRO |= Yes, I'm Goose. Do you need something? Whatever our shop sells is all we have, so don't go asking for anything else
Sal LoonINTRO |= Have to pardon me love, but everyone has the grumps lately. Can't blame the beer on this one, as our ales make you forget everything. I'm Sal, by the way.
Raven LoonINTRO |= What do you want? Raven's my name, and I like the colour black. It's dark. Darker than a tomb at midnight. I can tell you have darkness in you too. I would like that, but I hate everything right now.
Sage OnionINTRO |= I'm Sage the local healer. Pop by the apothecary anytime. Just don't waste my time with tiny spots or little coughs. Or anything, really.
Pearl OnionINTRO |= I don't like the look of you. Vale? Thought so; you stink of pigs and backwardness.
Charlotte OnionINTRO |= Are you talking to me? Are you talking to me? I don't see anyone else here. You are driving me nuts!
Lewis FlushingINTRO |= Sorry can't really chat much. Welcome though. Got a headache and not feeling my usual cheery self.
SiblingProgress10 |= A Vorpal Sword, eh? Aren't they weapons of darkness? Well, if that's what the Grandmaster says, then you must have one. And once again, like when we first learnt to walk, I can help guide you!
SiblingProgress10 |= From what I gather, Vorpal Swords are made from Abysstone. And where do you get that rarest of metals? Well... er... it's Wyrm poop. However, to get the Wyrm to poop it out, we need to feed it a particular foodstuff.
SiblingProgress10 |= I don't know what that food is, but Old Mother Hubbard may know. If she does help you, then feed that to the Wyrm and collect its poop.
SiblingProgress10 |= You don't know where the Wyrm is?! Well, neither do I, and I have been everywhere. I expect it is somewhere underground, though! 
SiblingProgress10 |= I'll do some digging. Not literally. You visit Old Mother Hubbard and return if you can get a recipe.
MotherHubbardWyrmRecipe |= Oh, hello! I was just thinking about you when up you pop, like some sort of corn that pops.
MotherHubbardWyrmRecipe |= A Wyrm? Laxatives? My dear, I don't make recipes to give people the squirties! Instead, I bake goods that soothe the tum and are easy on the bum.
MotherHubbardWyrmRecipe |= Yet, seeing how this is to rid the land of evil, I will help. I do have something in my old cookery book that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.
MotherHubbardWyrmRecipe |= Here it is. Lambton Pie. Baked in ancient times to celebrate the killing of a particularly nasty Wyrm. Of course, we don't want to kill it, but this is one spice the Wyrms won't like!
SiblingPieMade |= Oh, well done! That was unnervingly easy. I was expecting you to go on some big old fetch quest.
SiblingPieMade |= Well, while you were gone, I had a rummage through my library. There's a passage in a book I found called 'Legendary Wyrms - Where are they?' that says a monstrous Wyrm the size of a tunnel dwells in the depths of Woemarsh.
SiblingPieMade |= I can't recall seeing any mines or caves in that region, but you can bet your last radish it will be in Dreadwaters, which was once a cave-dwelling community.
SiblingPieMade |= And please don't let Daddy Long Legs get you.
FairweatherHAVECHILDREN |= So, here we are. The time has come! Age creeps upon you humans like vines.\nAs agreed in our contract, your shell must be passed to me.\nThe time to choose your next incarnation is upon us.\nYour experience and strength will add to theirs, and so the dance of life goes on.\nChoose now, and choose wisely...
FairweatherNOCHILDREN |= The time has come! Age creeps upon you humans like vines.\nAs agreed in our contract, your shell must be passed to me.\nThe time to choose your next incarnation is right now.\nI see you have no apparent heirs, so I present a fine choice of orphans from The Shoe.\nChoose now, and choose wisely...
FairweatherUPROOT |= So be it! All your possessions and skills will transfer to your chosen heir. Friendships you have forged will drop slightly. Your life will begin anew. If your chosen heir is under 18, time will pass and you will begin at 18 years of age.
FairweatherCHANGEOUTRO |= A fine choice I am sure. Come Shell, into the burrow.\nI shall see you again soon, Dreamer.
CircleTombTaskName |= The Circle and the Tomb
CircleTomb1 |= Find the pad in the Circle
CircleTomb1Desc |= Stand on the pad in The Circle. You can find this region east of Stonecrown. The pad sits below a large mysterious door.
CircleTomb2 |= Enter the tomb
CircleTomb2Desc |= Enter the tomb in The Circle and explore inside.
ReturnSiblingTaskName |= Return to your sibling <SiblingName>
ReturnSiblingDescription |= Return to Stonecrown to your sibling's house and tell them of your discovery.
ChickenMissingValeIntro |= Oh, come to help me find my chickens have ya? Something was creeping about last night and scared em off. I found droppings leading north, but that's it. If you find em, can you bring em back to their coop? They won't have left the Vale I'd wager. Probably gone somewhere quiet and secret.
ChickenMissingValeOutro |= Oh, you found the little chicken beggars! Thanks muchly. There's been worrying stuff happenin' lately. Strange noises, bad moods, trees bent out of shape. Weird stuff is brewing for sure. I heard more chickens had gone missing up in Summerdown. You should check out the noticeboard in Poppyhill, maybe? See if folks need help like I did. Anyway, here's yer reward.
ChickenMissingSDIntro |= How sweet of you to help me with the most fowl issue. My three little feathered friends have run away. I heard some strange growling in the night, and when I got my slippers on and looked out of the window, I saw nothing. It was too dark. So, I went outside with my lantern, and my beloved cluckers had fled the coop. Please find them, poor little dears.
ChickenMissingSDOutro |= Oh, Goddesses, bless you! My little chickens are back. I hope whatever scared them stays well away. Something evil has indeed been wandering amongst us. Folk in the village have been muttering about odd goings-on and a strange sense in the air. It has gone for the moment, but keep your wits about you if you wander into the darker places. And it would help if you visited Mellowbrook. I hear there may be more missing chickens there.
ChickenMissingMFIntro |= Badger! Badger! Oh, it's you. I shall drop the act. Need your aid. My chickens have taken fright at something and ran off south. Bring them back to their coop, and I'll pay you and think more kindly of you. Beep Beep! Oh, sorry, I forgot. Old habits die hard!
ChickenMissingMFOutro |= Oh, you found the chickens! Excellent. I hope whatever scared them has gone for good. There is an ill wind blowing lately. I've opened the gate north of here but I would avoid Toughwood if I were you. There is something amiss in there.
MISSING_CHICKENS_1_VILLAGER_GOSSIP |= Lost chickens, you say? I heard some clucking when I was in the woods recently. Funny-sounding cuckoos I thought!
MISSING_CHICKENS_2_VILLAGER_GOSSIP |= Lost chickens, you say? I heard some clucking when I had a romantic walk recently.
MISSING_CHICKENS_3_VILLAGER_GOSSIP |= Lost chickens, you say? I heard some clucking when I was in the village.
LemmySippFoundCuckoo |= Ah! Excellent! But do not think that I am going to do everything for you, <PlayerName>! You seem to have a bit of intelligence about you, so I think you should try to make the cure yourself.
LemmySippFoundCuckoo |= Head to the Powder Station in the preparation room where Boots does his good work and interact with it. We will make a chemist of you yet!
LemmySippMadeItem |= Oh, well done! You made it. If you ever want to use our powder station, we will charge you a nominal fee of 5 Brass per item. We don't allow youngsters to use the Cream station or Potion station, as they are a bit too dangerous for young fingers!
Icabod MoonGoodStoreIntro |= Ah, <PlayerName>! Thank you for coming! All you have to do for now is just serve any customers that come in. Just interact when they are standing at the counter. If they want to barter, please try to land your arrow in the green section! Usually, a shop owner can change stock and set prices, etc., but please just serve anyone that comes in for now. I will return at 1pm.
Icabod MoonGoodStoreOutro |= Thank you for that. I hope it all went well. Here's 15 Brass for your troubles. You should try owning a store one day. It's so much fun to keep an eye on stock and be flexible to the demands of your patrons. It's also a great way to earn Reputation!
WoemarshWandererTalk |= Off into Copperpot, are you? I would watch yourself in that village if I were you. Something is amiss, that's for sure. Used to be such a warm, friendly lot. They seem much colder these days. Something ain't right in the world. Watch yourself!
WoemarshGiftRejection |= I won't accept any gifts from you.
Mason MakerINTROPW |= Greetings! I'm a smithy, but you probably knew that. Enough about me, though. We are indebted to you for what you did, although don't go thinking that means extra discounts.
Gage MakerINTROPW |= Hey, it's the purifier of water! Welcome! You must be pretty brave to have been through Dreadwaters! I am Gage. Wish I was as brave as you!
Ava GanderINTROPW |= Hello. It's nice to see a new face around. I have heard gossip about your exploits, though. I also once saw Daddy Long Legs. I've not been able to sleep properly since.
Goose GanderINTROPW |= Yes, I'm Goose. Do you need something? I have been a trader all my life, and due to our little 'curse' I will probably be one for a long time!
Sal LoonINTROPW |= Nice to meet a local legend! Bad things in the water are never good for business. I rely on that water to make the ale go a bit further, but shhh, trade secret.
Raven LoonINTROPW |= Did you see Daddy Long Legs in Dreadwaters? He is, like, my hero. I bet he kicks all sorts of arse, and I bet his crib is off the scale dark! I'm Raven by the way. I changed my name from Percy to reflect my hobbies.
Sage OnionINTROPW |= I'm Sage, the local healer. If you need anything after your scary quest, then I'm your man.
Pearl OnionINTROPW |= Hello. Nice to meet you, <PlayerName>. Do you like dressing up too? Those of us from Woemarsh continue the traditions of our ancestors, which is why we dress way cooler than anyone else in Quill.
Charlotte OnionINTROPW |= Woah, it's you! The cleanser of wells. However, you could have also gotten rid of Daddy Long Legs, so we no longer have to burn those stinky old candles! I'm Charlotte, by the way. My last name is Onion, probably because I make you cry.
Lewis FlushingINTROPW |= Hey there! I'm Dennis. Not really. My name is Frank. Ok, ok, it's Mac. Charlie? Oh, ok, it's Lewis. I just can't be serious, man! My disposition is to be always sunny and a delight. If you know any excellent pranks, I did them first. I annoy the others, but we all live a long old time, so we've got to keep it fun! Don't you agree, Frannie? Or is it Freddie? Only kidding, <PlayerName>!
FairweatherRepProgress1 |= I see you have scratched the moss from your first milestone. Keep clawing my child. Eventually your nails will be dirty, but the stone will be clean, and you will see your name etched on it. Your destination will become closer with each milestone you scrape away.
FairweatherRepProgress2 |= Another step down the road. So many ways to raise your legend, but take small steps. We do not want you to trip and break your bones.
FairweatherRepProgress3 |= Your progress excites! Your potential seeps across the land like syrup. Soon your sweetness will cover it. It is intoxicating to smell.
FairweatherRepProgress4 |= Keep going, my friend. Your reputation rises, and the rewards are beginning to flow like the drink you call beer. Keep a steady hand and a keen eye on the prize. You are nearly halfway there, friend.
FairweatherRepProgress5 |= Yet another line in the mud stepped over. Your presence grows and my fur stands on end at the possibilities. Stride on and never be slowed, friend.
FairweatherRepProgress6 |= Quill awaits your return like autumn awaits the coming snows that hide from the sun. Winter never hides here, though. It is eternal. You will become the winter, eternal.
FairweatherRepProgress7 |= Closer and closer, the beetle walks to the nail. Do all you can, friend, to reach your destiny. You are becoming so, so close little beetle. Let that foul Jabberwock fall upon your spike!
FairweatherRepProgress8 |= Can you feel it? The power flowing through you? Can you feel the admiration of your kind? Do you bask in the warmth of adulation?\nDo not let fame and fortune cloud your mind at this late stage. The end of your task grows near, but it is merely the first of three. Remain focussed and the world will spin in your palm. You do know that your world spins, I hope?
FairweatherRepProgress9 |= One more step to go. Be brave, my friend. I can feel anticipation coursing through you. Your foe has tried to intimidate you, but your mind must be clear. Soon, you will face your fears and put them to rest.
FairweatherRepProgress10 |= A legend! I am impressed and even proud of you, my good friend. The hardest part is yet to come, though. Do you have what it takes?
FairweatherTaskComplete |= A fine feat for one so young. A legend and more. Hatred removed from the land, and your potential glows like a furnace. You have trials ahead, but for now, savour the sweetmeats of victory, for you have earned your place at the high table. The dream goes on, but your waking will come.
DDLSafePassageT1 |= No need to fear me. Not now. No, no, no.\nFairweather told me you were to be left alone. We made a trade. Yes, a trade was made. \nSeeking an audience with the Wyrm, I hear?\nThat door behind me is where you should go. Down, down, down. Go to the very bottom. \nThere, the Wyrm resides. \nYes, you are safe from me, for now, but the Wyrm - the Wyrm makes no trades! 
PottINTROShort |= First, you have the Kynseed gotten,\nPlant it now lest it be rotten.
PottINTROShort |= Grow the tree and roots so deep,\nA legacy that will f'rever keep.

UncleBillAfterTwigLetter |= Sounds like a new friend, potentially. He lives across the river at the top of the farm. Sadly that rotten old wooden bridge collapsed, so if you do want to go and say hello, then it needs repairing. Why don't you have a go at doing that? Could be fun!
UncleBillAfterTwigLetter |= You will need resources, but I have those for you. You might need some extra manpower, though. If you fancy trying, then interact with the Blueprint next to the bridge. There's a note on there that should help you work out what to do.
UncleBillAfterTwigLetter |= Before you go, we do need some seeds from the market in Festival Green. Here's 4 Brass. Any seeds will do. When you get them, come back here and you can plant them by interacting with any empty farming patch.
UncleBillAfterTwigLetter |= Busy day for you, so get cracking!
SiblingBridgeFinished |= Quality craftsmanship on that bridge! That should last another thousand years, for sure. Or until an Ogyr jumps on it.

SiblingWhistle |= <PlayerName>! 내가 뭘 찾았는지 봐! 재미있지 않아?! 애완동물 호루라기야. 여기, 가져가. <whistle>을 누르면 모든 애완동물 목록을 불러올 수 있어. 소환하거나 집으로 보내거나 상태를 확인할 수 있지. 가서 트러플을 탈 준비를 해보는 건 어때? 드루이다의 교차로에서 내 최고 기록을 깨봐!
SiblingRaceWon |= 오오오, 내 기록을 깼구나? 돼지 몰이 실력이 대단한걸. 퀼 곳곳에 트랙이 있나 보더라. 마을 게시판에서 도전 과제가 있는지 잘 살펴봐. 잘했어.

MotherHubbardMilk |= 네? 누구세요? 오! 내 우유를 가지고 있니? 그렇다면 들어오렴!
HousePaintingFinished |= 훨씬 낫네! 여기가 훨씬 좋아졌어. 드루이다는 너의 노고에 고마워하실거야. 언젠가 이 농장을 물려받게 된다면 원하는 대로 꾸밀 수 있을 거야!
Day11Intro |= Hello there! Up and at it and ready for the day?
Day11Intro |= There's an event you might like to try today down at Festival Green.
Day11Intro |= Some of the villagers have organised a Summertide Jam-making contest.
Day11Intro |= Go find the Events Master on Festival Green for details.
Day11Intro |= You can use the stove in the farmhouse to make some jams. There are Strawberries, Blueberries and even Nightberries to pick around the farm. And the honey is in the hive.
Day11Intro |= Whatever you decide to cook, good luck! Don't worry if you don't win first time out. Some of Vale's adults do get very competitive! But, heh, you never know!

UncleDay13 |= 서머타이드가 가까워졌구나! 
UncleDay13 |= I've got a lovely idea for something for you to build today. Did you know you can collect animal poo in a wooden bucket and pour it onto crop patches?
UncleDay13 |= You can use a Composter to store excess poops for when you need it. I've added a Pig Composter to your Customisation Catalogue if you want to build one. You'll need a little wood and a friend to help out. They don't take long to build. Just don't build it too near the house, eh? *wink*
UncleDay13 |= Oh, and this came for you. It's from that stickboy across the river. 

TwigLetterRead |= Intriguing. I would watch yourself with that boy. Never trust a person who scratches his nose with his leg. Anyway, be careful today. I heard talk of a monster wandering around outside the Vale. I'm not scared, but I don't want you eaten, and your lazy bones sucked on like a lollipop.
UncleBillShed |= Nice! Teamwork makes the shed work! I found a poo bucket for fertilising the crops. I'll put it in the Tool Shed. Simply interact with it to see what is inside. 
UncleBillShed |= As for the rest of that plot... feel free to do what you want with it. You can access Customisation anytime from the farm's map button, and then browse the catalogue of unlocked items for you to place in any unlocked plots of land around Willowdown.

JogonINTRO |= Och! Here ye are! Have heard many things about ye. I'm Jogon, Master of combat. If ye want to protect yerself then I can teach yer the art of clobberin' beasties. That behind me is Simplewood. It's full o nasty beasties, and they seem even more angry lately, so ye best learn how to defend yerself.
JogonINTRO |= Ach! You haven't even got a sword! You cannae enter here til ye are armed, so off ye trot to Poppyhill, to the east. See the Smithy there and get yerself a good blade, then come back here and I'll teach ye the basics.
JogonSeekMoon |= Och? What's that you are asking me about? A door? That sounds like a place I once went to. Ye should seek it fer sure. Go and see Moon in Drownhill. She will tell ye the rest of what ye need to know and help ye learn to fire a bow. Ach! That rhymed! I'm a poet 'n' I don't know it, aye? Fare thee well, basher of beasties!

JogonCOMBAT_TUTORIAL_NEED_WEAPON |= What?! I told ye to bring a sword. Go get one from Poppyhill blacksmiths or wherever. C'mon! Pull it together! It's all about the preparation!
JogonCOMBAT_TUTORIAL_BEGIN |= Ready to learn the fine art of clobberin'? Then let's get cracking... some ribs!
JogonDefeatedJW |= You slew the beastie! I always knew ye had it in yer! I bow to yer skills! As a token of my reverence, take this sword. It is some legendary thing I pulled from a big beasties belly way back. Cost me this scar, but was worth it to find that in its guts. I hope ye can make good use of it, legend.

PoppyhillGuardIntro |= 그런데 이게 다 뭐야? 이상하게 생긴 말썽꾸러기네!
PoppyhillGuardIntro |= 특별한 보증 없이는 포피힐에 들어갈 수 없어. 신분이 확실한 사람이 보증을 서야만 출입증을 발급받아 마음대로 드나들 수 있어.
PoppyhillGuardIntro |= 온갖 종류의 미지의 것들이 돌아다니는 일이 있어서는 안 돼. 특히 숲에서 괴물이 나오고 북쪽에서 이상한 일이 일어나는 경우에는 더욱 그렇지.
PoppyhillGuardIntro |= 슈에 사는 할머니에게 가서 얘기해 봐. 그녀가 당신을 보증할 수 있다면 충분해. 게다가 아주 가까운 곳에 있으니 구두 가죽을 구할 수 있을 거야. 홈스테드 북동쪽에 있는 동굴로 가봐.
PoppyhillGuardRepeat |= 어이! 승인을 받기 전까지는 입장불가야!
PoppyhillGuardHasPass |= 오! 그게 바로 티켓이야! 아, 이 농담은 이미 한 거지? 그럼 통과해도 되겠네. 불편하게 해서 미안해. 나이다의 네이밍 너트를 제대로 써봐야 하거든. 그럼 가봐. Zzzzz.
GuardRandom |= Zzzzzz
GuardRandom |= Hmmmwassatzzzzzz
GuardRandom |= Grumblemumble
GuardRandom |= Snore
GuardRandom |= Mindhowyougohmmmzzzz

MrsFoster_Locked |= 미안하지만 지금은 입양할 여유가 없는 것 같네. 자녀의 미래 복지를 지원할 수 있는 수단이 있음을 보여주기 위해서는 최소한 500 브라스를 소지해야해.
MrsFoster_Intro |= 오! 안녕! 오랜 시간이 흘렀지만 그 장난꾸러기 눈빛은 어디서든 알아볼 수 있겠네. <PlayerName>을(를) 슈에서 다시 만나서 반가워. 빌 삼촌 소식을 듣고 너무 안타까웠어. 그는 좋은 영혼이었지.
MrsFoster_Intro |= Are you looking for a child of your own? If you ever feel like giving one of my charges a happy home, then all you need is proof you have the means to properly support their future wellbeing. 500 Brass is the right amount. Come talk to me again when you want to take the jump into parenthood. I'm sure you would make a great job of it.
MrsFoster_Endorsement |= An endorsement, eh? Well, I would love to give you one, but I need to see some proof of a good deed. As it happens, I have been struggling for milk lately to feed the bairns. If you can build me a cow shed to make my cow, Rose, happier, then I shall gladly endorse you. I appreciate the help. It's all about giving back, don't you agree?
MrsFoster_AlreadyCompletedShed |= An endorsement? You've certainly shown your community spirit by making Rose happy with her new shed!
MrsFoster_CompletedShed |= Oh, that's wonderful! Rose will be so happy. A happy cow makes good milk.
MrsFoster_CompletedShed |= As promised, here's a pass to get you into Poppyhill. Be careful in there, though. The people of Poppyhill do have some terrible habits and like a bit of fun. And be careful when travelling! There's odd stuff about lately. Farewell, and say hello to <SiblingName>for me when you see them.
MrsFoster_Return |= Welcome back! Looking for a child to care for, and who will eventually look after you? Here are the ones I think are most suitable.
MrsFoster_Full |= Oh, bless me! I think you are already at capacity. Our beloved Goddesses do not allow for four. Please feel free to return should you ever have space for one of our wonderful children.

MoonPostTutorial |= What is that you say, <PlayerName>? Do you seek the ancient door and the secrets that lie within? I have been in that place myself, and there is nothing to fear. Head to The Circle, north then east of here, past The Shingles. There, you should read the text on the Monolith outside the tomb.
MoonPostTutorial |= Before you head off, though, come outside. There is a problem you will need to deal with.
MoonBridgeIntro |= A giant beast stomped through this region the other night and destroyed this bridge. It made a terrible noise! It would be best if you found a way to fix it! You will need some powerful glue. I recommend Slime. You can get some by defeating the Lobs of Simplewood in combat. That could be a good test of all your new fighting abilities.
MoonBridgeIntro |= I wish you luck. Remember to come and see me when you wish to unlock new skills. Farewell, hunter.

TourGuideIntro |= Well, pingypangyplipplops, if it isn't a human bean!
TourGuideIntro |= Welcome, Felchild!
TourGuideIntro |= My name is Gladys. And you are <PlayerName>? I am the official tour guide for this beautiful land. 
TourGuideIntro |= Why don't you have a look around? I will happily tell you more. I don't get to do this often, so I would appreciate the practice! I have one job, and the only visitors I get are Fairies wearing beards and Gnomes wearing fake wings.
TourGuideLocation1 |= This is a Yum tree. Here, you can collect the wondrous delicacy we call Yum. The tree has stood here for as long as Gnomes have sat by ponds. The woodland around it was grown from the seeds of falling stars, so they say.
TourGuideLocation2 |= This is our Fairy Fountain. You can collect Cleansing Water here. It is very refreshing. They say the water is the saliva of the Fae Goddesses. Tasty.
TourGuideLocation2 |= Interact with it, and if you have an empty jar or metal bucket, you can take your fill of the purest water.
TourGuideLocation3 |= This is the bustling centre of Tir Na Nog. You can shop at Pixie Lottery's store or visit our tall Tinker. There is plenty for everyone to do, providing you enjoy limited shopping and changing your business specialisation.
TourGuideLocation4 |= In this cave is a little grotto where one can mine Luminium. It's a light ore, literally. Anything you make with it glows. It's a relatively strong metal. Our Tinker once made me a toilet seat from it so I could go in the night and see what I was doing.
TourGuideLocation5 |= Inside that door, you will find Gnome Edmunds. He runs the local gaming establishment. You pop realistic-looking balloons to win prizes. It's a party house! I wouldn't swap it for a shop, and I am out of references.
WitchhunterTotemOutro |= Nicely done with that evil Totem. I'd keep your eyes peeled for them, or listen out for hints, watch Noticeboards, etc. I am sure they will turn up again somewhere, but for now, you gave those buggers a taste of Mr Stabs.
WitchhunterTotemOutro |= We will meet again. Now, while I am here, I want to get some tips from Mr Marshtyt for my pansies...
PlotsBlockageCleared |= Glad that blockage is gone.
PlotsBlockageCleared |= Cheers for clearing that mess up, <PlayerName>.
PlotsBlockageCleared |= I can finally get back to pranking.

PaigeLyricIntro |= Ahh! They said you would come, the spirits in my dreams. You must be <PlayerName>.
PaigeLyricIntro |= I am Paige, and some say I am the local smarty pants of Woemarsh. We need your help with a problem, but before I can even begin to tell you more, this unnatural fog needs to be lifted so we can safely navigate the marsh.
PaigeLyricIntro |= I once saw a fog such as this cleared by Lyric. She's a reclusive music maker, and I was astonished to see her blow some sort of musical instrument which made the mists vanish instantly! She was so cool! She even gave me a beautiful lute signed with her name. 
PaigeLyricIntro |= You should seek her out. She lives in the Ferrous Footway. I'm needed here, else I would do it myself. 
PaigeLyricIntro |= Perhaps the lute she gave me may help you unlock doors with her? She might think you are a fan of hers. 
PaigeLyricGoAway |= You need to be going the other way, back to The Shingles.
PaigeClearedFog |= That's the instrument I saw Lyric use - the fog clearing one! Now we can get to Frogmarsh and the Dreadwaters' gate. Meet me there when you are ready. If you go to Copperpot first, just be warned that the folks there are a bit moody, but that's the problem I want you to help us with. See you in Frogmarsh... just go up, then straight up again!
LyricINTRO |= Rock on! You found a way to open the door. That's, like, totally mallow. Cleudos.
LyricINTRO |= I'm Lyric, THE musical superstar. As you might guess, I'm not from Quill. When I say star, I mean it, dud.
LyricINTRO |= I just love loud, thrashing music. Check out my posters of my most favourite bands - Eviticus, Dracthonia and Apex Croissant. Yeahhh! 
LyricINTRO |= Anyway, what is so spooky that you thrummed your way into here to see me?
LyricINTRO |= Fog?
LyricINTRO |= Oh, those 'noying foggo's. Yeah, they can be a real downer.
LyricINTRO |= What you need is my Calmonica, dud.
LyricINTRO |= Tell you what. You plink out a few strums with me, and I'll give it to you. Get your lute out, dud, and let's shrift!

LyricINTROSHORT |= Rock on! You found a way to open the door. That's, like, totally mallow. Cleudos.
LyricINTROSHORT |= I'm Lyric, THE musical superstar. As you might guess, I'm not from Quill. When I say star, I mean it, dud.
LyricINTROSHORT |= I just love loud, thrashing music. Check out my posters of my most favourite bands - Eviticus, Dracthonia and Apex Croissant. Yeahhh!

LyricIntroRepeat |= Tell you what. You plink out a few strums with me, and I'll give it to you. Get your lute out, dud, and let's shrift!
LyricLutePlayed |= That is radioactive playing, dud. Like, my ears are seriously throbbing. Corking.
LyricLutePlayed |= As promised, here's the Calmonica. Blow some sweet tunes out of that, and any weather will calm right the flump down.
LyricLutePlayed |= Come see me again, sometime, dud. I will try and make up even more weird words and phrases to confuse you. *wink*
LyricRockIntro |= Wooah dude! If it isn't <PlayerName>. Do you always answer every call for help?
LyricRockIntro |= While searching for good rock, I heard some gnarly drums in Deep Mine. I have heard those beats before, and my investigations led me to discover that it was the one and only Axel Grease! He was the most excellent drummer of all time and part of the heavy rock titans called 'Thunderblast Exorcism'. Legend says that they broke up, but on the night of their comeback reunion, they were all tragically killed by lightning. Quite frightening.
LyricRockIntro |= Something must have stirred their resting spirits if they are back playing again. Maybe that monster you are chasing around after. The Jabberwock, right? Well, the dead are afoot; we must defoot them and return them to the afterlife.
LyricRockIntro |= Anyway, I searched for Axel, but I couldn't find the source. Probably because he's dead. Dead good!
LyricRockIntro |= You have various trinkets that might help - and I thought you might like to help me out. We need to reunite the band and lay the restless dead back to rest!
AxelIntro |= Hey, man! Nice to see you! Amazed you can see me!
AxelIntro |= I'm Axel Grease! YEEAAAAHHHH! I'm the drummer of Thunderblast Exorcism. Well, I was.
AxelIntro |= Something woke me up, and now all the other dead folk are awake and whining and moaning, so I came here to drown out their wails with some tip-top tapping.
AxelIntro |= What's that you say? A reunion to exorcise the angry spirits? Count me in! A one-two-three!
AxelIntro |= If you want to find the other guys, you might need to listen out for their playing. I'd try Mellowmine. Jammy used to love the acoustics in there. So mellow!
AxelIntro |= The boys are coming back! Rock on!
JammyIntro |= Heyyy! Yeah, I'm Jammy. Nice to meet you, man.
JammyIntro |= I was the guitarist of Thunderblast Exorcism. My licks could make the ladies scream!
JammyIntro |= I was playing up a storm when an actual storm struck. Shock and roll, man!
JammyIntro |= Anyway, I was chilling in peace when suddenly, I wasn't. Something bad is out there, man. Stirring up us dead dudes. Bad juju!
JammyIntro |= Band reunion? Exorcism? Woooahh! I'd be really into that.
JammyIntro |= So you spoke to Axel, and he's up for it? Then you need to go find Chez Long, real name Malcolm Trowel.
JammyIntro |= He was the lead singer of the band. Last I heard, he was getting inspiration from the dead in the Burial Grounds in the Vale. Look for an old crypt. Good luck, man!
ChezIntro |= Gore blimey mate! You surprised me there!
ChezIntro |= Yeah, I'm Chez, what of it? I don't do autographs, but seeing as I haven't met a fan in a thousand years or more, where's your pen?
ChezIntro |= You aren't the sort of fan I am used to. In my heyday, it was all leather. Basically, old people.
ChezIntro |= What's that you say? A reunion? With the band? 
ChezIntro |= Sounds absolutely right up my alley, mate! You'll need to find a stage worthy of such rock gods though! Just find the place, and we'll be there, mate.
ChezIntro |= Let's turn it up to 12!
LyricFixStage |= You got the band back together! Rock on! They are going to love playing a live gig again. The audience will all be technically dead, mind you, but you and I count as living, right?! Let's ride the lightning!
LyricFixStage |= So, we need a venue eh? Well, in FestField there's just the place.
LyricFixStage |= Sadly, it's still broken from my last concert there. Let's just say something heavy and metallic dropped through it.
LyricFixStage |= Once fixed, it's all set for midnight on Goddess Day. Weeeaarrggghhh! It's going to be framptious!
LyricFixStage |= Be there or be a 4-sided shape! Now go fix the stage!
LyricRockConcertIntro |= You came! Though, you could have dressed up for it, like put on a pair of pants so tight you can barely walk. Anyhow, let's get this show on the white stone path!

BrambleIntro1 |= Hmmm ho! Well, well, well. He said you would come, hmmm? It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Seedling.
BrambleIntro1 |= I am the Bramble King, and this is my Lady, the Queen of Thorns. Hmmm.
BrambleIntro2 |= A pleasure to make your acquaintance. You have interesting water within you. We know everything about you. Your quest is noble. Just be careful of the shadows. Stay in the light whenever you can.
BrambleIntro2 |= Please enjoy your visit here. Do not listen too closely to the music of the deep forest, nor drink the waters of our fountains, though. One such as yourself should avoid such temptations.
BrambleIntro3 |= There is a shop to the north and a glade of Shadderwryth to the east. We also have a market, hmmm, but a token is needed. We Mossmen and Dryads do like to shop, hmmm. We sometimes might even visit Quill.
BrambleIntro4 |= You should also go and see the Rootmother. She is to the east, in the directions that you humans use. To us, she is rootward, but then again, every direction is rootward.
BrambleIntro4 |= Go now, seedling. May your branches grow long and your buds blossom.

BrambleRepeatKing |= There is a shop to the north and a glade of Shadderwryth to the east. We also have a market, hmmm, but a token is needed. We Mossmen and Dryads do like to shop, hmmm. We sometimes might even visit Quill.
BrambleRepeatQueen |= You should also go and see the Rootmother. She is to the east, in the directions that you humans use. To us, she is rootward, but then again, every direction is rootward.

RootMotherSleeping |= Zzzzzzzz.
FoundGreenChild |= 아하, 네가 날 찾았어!

LyricVoideIntro |= 우우우와아! 돌아온 걸 환영해, 친구.
LyricVoideIntro |= How's it been hanging since we last spoke? I have been hanging some stellar tunes!
LyricVoideIntro |= 메테오리트 에?
LyricVoideIntro |= I used to have a load, but I traded them in for my amps. Sorry dude!
LyricVoideIntro |= I know where you can get more, but you will have to travel pretty far and face off with the worst monster ever... my Dad.
LyricVoideIntro |= Yeah, he probably has what you need to fix that bridge... Just be warned, he is a TOTALLY TOTAL TWERPILICIOUS TWERP.
LyricVoideIntro |= You will need the Cosmic Bell to get his attention. Go to the very top of Voide and ring it. He can hear it in any dimension, era or star system. Use it, and he will appear. He moves pretty fast when there's money to be made.
LyricVoideIntro |= Just don't mention me AT ALL. He is such a complete pig trotter.
LyricVoideIntro |= Now, excuse me, dude, I gotta go get rid of my Dad headache with extremely loud music!
JackIntro |= 벨을 누르셨고 제가 왔습니다!
JackIntro |= 오! 새 손님이 왔군! 이런 곳에서 흔히 볼 수 있는 고객은 아니지만, 내 상품은 아무도 판단하지 않지.
JackIntro |= 내 이름은 잭... 만물상 잭이야.
JackIntro |= 거래는 내 사업이고 사업은 좋지!
JackIntro |= 나는 안목 있는 고객을 위해 은하계 및 차원간 거래 서비스를 제공하지.\n너는 그것을 원해; 문자 그대로의 갈고리나 문자 그대로의 도둑질을 통해 얻을 수 있지.
JackIntro |= I have a retail store on Peckham IV and various warehouses from Saturn to the 5th dimension.\nI've been in business since the dawning of the Age of Aquarius.\nMy clients include Gods and Demons, amoebas and timedukes, titans and thimblefolk.
JackIntro |= I take cash, credit card, Nebuline or souls. Pan-galactic Express? That'll do nicely. That always triggers a nice response from me.
JackIntro |= In your case, Brass is acceptable, mainly because it is in high demand by the Brasseaters of IBS Major. 
JackIntro |= Now then, what can I do you for?
JackIntroRepeat |= Greetings again! What may I do for you this fine cosmic day?

Ghost1PH |= Ohhhh! Beware! You come to seek the mould. A fearsome creature guards it. I have one of the code numbers you need to access the key from the chest! My compatriots will tell you more about 'her'. Trouble lies ahead.
Ghost1PH |= My number for you is 6. Beware! Ohhhh!
Ghost2PH |= So, you met the first of us and want my code? You should know what you are getting yourself in for! The three of us were adventurers long ago and were trying to uncover the tomb's treasures. After much searching, we found the key and entered. Inside, we came across a sarcophagus, which we carefully prised open. Within, we found 'her'. She was asleep. Garth went to take a closer look and... well, let's say we are where we are. Dead.
Ghost2PH |= Garth can tell you more. My code number for you is 6. Take great heed!
Ghost3PH |= So, you have spoken to my comrades. Yes, I was the stupid one that woke her. Do not go near her unless you are prepared... and can run quickly!
Ghost3PH |= There is a way to banish her, as written in a book we put in the chest with the tomb key. If only I had not been greedy and forgotten what we needed to do... well... then it would be a different story.
Ghost3PH |= Take my code number... 8. The whole number is 668, the number of the Beast's mum.
Ghost3PH |= The creature. She is a foul and evil being. Be strong! Stay true to your goal! Focus!
Ghost3PH |= Good luck, friend.

MoonAwaitingMeleeComplete |= Greetings. I am Moon, the Master Archer. My comrade-in-arms, Jogon, said you would come. You should probably go and complete his training first. I will be here, awaiting your next step.
SiblingDay6 |= It's a special day today. It's Uncle Bill's birthday. We are going on a family picnic! How exciting!
SiblingDay6 |= We are off to Cuckoo Wood. Meet us there at noon!
UncleBillMissedPicnic |= Oh. I am a bit sad you couldn't attend my birthday picnic, but I understand if you were busy. It would have been lovely to share that with you, that's all.
SiblingMissedPicnic |= Where were you? You missed it! You couldn't find your bottom with an atlas at times. I could tell Uncle Bill was sad about it, but we had a great time without you anyway. You need to just think of others sometimes. Or get a better dandelion!


Uncle BillINTRO |= 아! <PlayerName>. 거기있었구나! 잘 적응하고 있니? 집안일이 귀찮지 않길 바란다. 나는 예전만큼 젊지 않아서 모든 것을 스스로 할 수 없어. 곧 여름이 다가오니 축제를 준비해야 할 것 같아.
Uncle BillINTRO |= 진행 상황 화면에서 모든 진행 상황을 확인할 수 있단다. 지금 살펴보는 건 어떠니?

BillAfterProgress |= 받아들여야 할 것이 많다는 것을 안다. 서두를 필요는 없다는 것만 기억해. 인생을 마음대로 누리렴. 시간은 우리 모두를 따라잡을 수는 있지만 아주 느리게 흘러가는 것이니 스트레스 받지 말고 마음껏 인생을 살아보거라. 이모가 매일 그렇게 말하곤했지. 자, 이제 시작하자. 막히면 일시 정지 메뉴의 힌트 및 팁과 많은 화면의 왼쪽 상단에 도움말 버튼이 있단다.
HubbardCabbageSeed |= 양배추가 필요하다면 이 씨앗을 사용해 양배추를 재배해보렴. 원한다면 내 작물 밭을 자유롭게 사용해. 짜잔!

UncleDay12 |= Summertide is nearly here. It's very exciting! It is when all the Vale community gather to celebrate our beloved Goddesses, especially our patron, Druida.
UncleDay12 |= I was thinking that we should do more for the community. There are some derelict houses around, in Cuckoo Wood and Cowpat Farm.
UncleDay12 |= Why don't you and some friends start to make them liveable again? New people might then appear, and with new faces comes new opportunities. Friendships, maybe even romance *wink*. No marrying 'til after you are 18, though! Ha ha! 

ProgressScreen_Gamepad |= <progress>로 진행 상황 화면을 엽니다.
ProgressScreen_KBM |= <progress>로 진행 상황 화면을 열거나 화면 왼쪽 하단의 나무 아이콘을 클릭합니다.

NedDay2 |= 안녕, 이웃주민! 만나서 반가워요. 난 네드예요. 네드 스크럼피. 당신 집 바로 남쪽에 있는 농장에 살아요. 새로 쌍둥이가 왔다고 들었어요. 나도 쌍둥이가 있는데 재밌지 않아요? 당신이나 당신 가족이 마을에 들러서 인사하길 바랐어요.
NedDay2 |= 친구를 사귀는 것은 매우 중요하죠, 그렇죠?
NedDay2 |= 친구의 열매를 따고, 농작물을 공유하고, 생활에 도움이 되는 정보를 얻고. 친구로부터 모든 종류의 혜택을 얻을 수 있어요.
NedDay2 |= 친구를 사귀는 가장 좋은 방법은 매일 한 번씩 친구에게 선물을 주고 호의를 베푸는 거죠. 우정 포인트(FP)를 획득하여 우정 레벨을 높일 수 있어요.
NedDay2 |= 누군가의 사랑 레벨을 올리면 결혼까지 할 수 있어요!
NedDay2 |= 결혼은 저에게 맞지 않는다고 생각하지만, 18 살이 넘어 성인이 되면 제 사업 제국을 운영할 수 있도록 도와줄 가족을 갖고 싶을지도 모르겠어요!
NedDay2 |= 있잖아요, <PlayerName>. 테스티 에이커스의 비참한 우리 가족을 대상으로 연습해 보세요. 우리 아빠를 행복하게 만드는 데 도전할 준비가 되었는지 확인해 보세요! 가는 길에 도움을 드리기 위해 아버지가 사과, 파이크, 토끼 사탕을 좋아한다고 말할 수 있지만, 제가 말했다고 하지 마세요!
NedDay2 |= 또 만나요.


PriestIntro |= 아! 어서 오세요! 어서 오세요!
PriestIntro |= Have you come to seek my services? I am the High Priest of Quill. I bless everything - marriages, water and even divorces!
PriestIntro |= If the spirit of love has entwined you with another, then you will need to offer your beloved a White Rose, which grows just there, except in Winter.
PriestIntro |= To marry, gift that to the one you love, and they will ask you to bake a fresh new Pie of You and I, which you must return to me in exchange for a Binding Band. Once you give your loved one the band, you can arrange the wedding, which takes place right here!
PriestIntro |= Here is the recipe for the Pie of You and I, should you ever decide to go down the road to marriage. Talk to me anytime about my other services, and feel free to read the books lying around for more information. May the spirit of love go with you.
LyricDismiss |= Sorry, can't talk now! I'm in the zone!

PottShopAdvice |= Grand Masters guide you to Renown,\nReputation points are all around,\nPott's advice, to the fore,\nBuy yerself the Vale Goods Store!
GrandmasterAfterJabber |= We had a wager that we'd not see you again! You've already had all our gifts, but we closely watch your progress now that the Jabberwock has gone.\nIt beats reading all those books we collected when we were alive!
