FAMILYVISIT_HOW_ARE_YOU |= I am good, thank you. It's lovely to be back here, reminiscing. I miss the place.
FAMILYVISIT_HOW_ARE_YOU |= I've been better, but coming here is a breath of fresh air. It always did have a nice smell about it.
FAMILYVISIT_HOW_ARE_YOU |= I am doing well, thanks for asking. I like my new home despite the big spiders. I also have a very creaky floorboard, but can't complain.
FAMILYVISIT_HOW_ARE_YOU |= I am good, thank you. Always a pleasure to see you and the farm. I wonder who originally built the place? It's really big. Are you going to make it look much nicer? Anyway, it's good to see those timbers once more.
FAMILYVISIT_HOW_ARE_YOU |= I am doing great! Coming here is great for nostalgia, but I am forging new memories in my own gaff now.
FAMILYVISIT_HOW_ARE_YOU |= Wonderful, thanks! Visiting here is very calming. Things have been busy at home, so it is nice to just stretch my legs and catch up on somewhere I cherish.
FAMILYVISIT_HOW_ARE_YOU |= Good to be here! My house has a very naughty Brounie, and he has a love of pranks. At least he keeps the dust down and the garden neat.
FAMILYVISIT_HOW_ARE_YOU |= I'm doing OK. You know, it is nice being able to come back and visit. I miss not living here, sometimes.
FAMILYVISIT_HOW_ARE_YOU |= I'm enjoying this little stroll down memory lane, coming back to the farm. I notice that Pott is still not doing much, is he? Is he bugged?
FAMILYVISIT_HOW_ARE_YOU |= I'm a little teary eyed wondering where time has gone since I used to live here.
FAMILYVISIT_HOW_ARE_YOU |= I was OK until I saw the Kynseed Tree and remembered days, friends and pets passed. I'm having a little wobble but am fine!
FAMILYVISIT_HOW_ARE_YOU |= 윌로우다운 농장으로 돌아가는 게 너무 즐거워. 행복한 추억이 가득하길 바라.
FAMILYVISIT_HOW_ARE_YOU |= I'm a bit sad. I miss living here. But, life moves on. We grow up, grow apart but this place will always connect us. We are family, after all.

FAMILYVISIT_WHATS_HAPPENING |= I am just taking in the sights and smells of your beautiful farm. I always wondered where the actual Willow tree is, though.
FAMILYVISIT_WHATS_HAPPENING |= I'm just having a day out. The walls close in sometimes, so a walk and new scenery is good for the mind, body and soul.
FAMILYVISIT_WHATS_HAPPENING |= I am just getting away for a little break and to catch up with old friends.
FAMILYVISIT_WHATS_HAPPENING |= I am visiting you, then off to see other old pals, maybe. Perhaps do some shopping.
FAMILYVISIT_WHATS_HAPPENING |= A good healthy walk reinvigorates. I am staying clear of dark shadows and rustling bushes, though!
FAMILYVISIT_WHATS_HAPPENING |= Having a nostalgia burst, so I decided to visit my old haunts. Not that I am a ghost or anything.
FAMILYVISIT_WHATS_HAPPENING |= What is happening? Well, a happy walk and a visit to people I care for is the order of the day.
FAMILYVISIT_WHATS_HAPPENING |= I'm wondering where I left that favourite radish of mine all those moons ago.
FAMILYVISIT_WHATS_HAPPENING |= I'm hoping to get some inspiration for how to do up my own place, now.
FAMILYVISIT_WHATS_HAPPENING |= I'm thinking that I actually saw a Salmon in our old river just now.
FAMILYVISIT_WHATS_HAPPENING |= I'm going to wander around the old place, then might head off to see Hubbard and give her a pat on the head.
FAMILYVISIT_WHATS_HAPPENING |= I'm doing this quick nostalgia trip around the farm, then I might head into the village and see if anyone new is performing on stage in the tavern. 
FAMILYVISIT_WHATS_HAPPENING |= I'm looking for my old favourite bee. Do you think he is still alive?
